  "geographic_range": "Rocky Mountain twayblade is one of the most common representatives of the Orchid Family in the Canadian Rockies. It delights in the recesses of damp woods, and grows among mosses and other moisture-loving plants, where the sunshine filters but faintly through the trees. The flowers vary in color from yellowish green to green or purple. The plants are so small and so nearly uniform in color that they are easily overlooked among other vegetation. Such unobtrusive plants as these show little affinity in their general appearance with their more showy relatives, such as the ladyslippers and the brilliant exotic orchids of our hothouses.",
