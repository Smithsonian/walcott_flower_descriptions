AMERICAN COLUMBINE
Aquilegia canadensis Linnaeus
Of all the spring wild flowers, none is more lovely than the columbine which we find in rocky woods or on exposed ledges. Its bright green leaves and crimson-and-gold flowers are borne on slender, graceful stems. The bumble bees are attracted to the feast of nectar prepared for them, and the brilliant color attracts also the ruby-throated humming-bird. Taken to England by a relative of John Tradescant, gardener to King Charles the First, the American columbine has yielded readily to cultivation, but is never so lovely as when growing in its native habitat. Linnaeus gave the genus its name from a fancied resemblance of the spurs of the flower to the talons of an eagle.
American columbine ranges from Georgia to Texas, and northward to Nova Scotia and Northwest Territory. Closely related species grow in Florida.
The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.
