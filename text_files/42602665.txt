BUTTERFLYWEED
Asclepias tuberosa Linnaeus
The butterflyweed is probably our most beautiful orange-colored wild flower. Growing in poor sandy soil, it forms masses of brilliant color wherever it finds a congenial foothold. The plants are visited by hosts of butterflies, some of them especially adapted to the cross pollination of the flowers, which have entirely lost the ability to fertilize themselves. Only insects with long tongues can reach the nectar hidden in the deep recesses of the complicated blossoms, whose structure definitely places the plant in the Milkweed Family. Curiously enough, however, its juice is not milky. The Indians are said to have used the long roots of this and other milkweeds as a remedy for various maladies, and herb doctors of a later day use them under the name of pleurisy-root. Linnaeus dedicated the family to Aesculapius on account of its alleged healing qualities, though the name, as he spelled it, is a Latinized corruption. The plant yields easily to cultivation, provided it is planted in dry, sterile soil, and should be grown in every wildflower garden with bright sunny exposure.
Butterfly weed has a wide range, extending from Florida to northern Mexico and north to Maine, Ontario, Minnesota, and Colorado.
The specimen sketched was found neat Washington, District of Columbia.
