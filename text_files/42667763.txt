LANCELEAF PAINTBRUSH
Castilleja lancifolia Rydberg
The habit of the lanceleaf paintbrush is quite different from that of many other members of the genus Castilleja, as it has a long creeping, perennial rootstock. Usually it is found in moist woods on the lower levels of the eastern slopes of the Rockies. Being protected by sheltering trees and herbs from the sharp frosts that often come in mid-August, it is one of the last flowers to be found in full bloom. The vivid red of the bracts surrounding the flowers, which form dense spikes at the ends of the stiff stems, is especially noticeable to one traveling the mountain trails at this season. In burnt-timber areas it is likely to have survived the ravages of fire, since the rootstock is protected from the heat by the soil above.
This striking member of the Figwort Family ranges from Colorado and Utah north to Alberta and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was found in the valley of the Pipestone River, fifteen miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
