WRIGHT PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon wrightii Hooker
By the side of the winding road leading up the dry slopes of Tumamoc Hill to the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution, near Tucson, Arizona, I found great clumps of this beautiful pentstemon. The stems supporting the graceful flower panicles were two and a half feet high. The lovely color of the blossoms was a delight to all who passed. The plants grew out of the disintegrated rock of the mountain and subsisted with so little soil that it seemed all but impossible for them to flourish in such perfection in so arid a spot.
The pentstemons are named from the fact that in addition to their four normal stamens, they have a fifth sterile stamen which often is conspicuous because it is covered with hairs, and often extends well up toward the mouth of the corolla. The pentstemons belong to the Figwort Family.
