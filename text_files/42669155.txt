WESTERN MONKEYFLOWER
Mimulus guttatus Don
The moist earth in the vicinity of springs and along the banks of the little streams that flow from them, is favorable for the lush growth of the western monkeyflower. Its clear yellow flowers are set off to perfection by the brilliant green leaves. The plant is easily crushed, and therefore difficult to carry away from its chosen situation, but with care it will last if kept in water in a cool place.
We found this specimen near Vancouver, but it also occurs from northern Mexico and New Mexico to California, Alaska, and Saskatchewan. It belongs to the Figwort Family.
