PINK FLEABANE
Erigeron caespitosus Nuttall
The pink fleabane may be seen in great perfection in June in the upper Columbia River Valley. It seems to delight in dry, sandy soils, and especially after a shower, its graceful clumps of daisylike flowers, variously shaded from white to pink or pale purple, are a delight to the eye. It is a member of a group of plants widely distributed in North America, and represented in the Rocky Mountains by a hundred or more Species.
Pink fleabane ranges from Colorado and Utah to the Yukon.
The specimen drawn was collected in the Saskatchewan River Valley, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
