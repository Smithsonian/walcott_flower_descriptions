GOLDENPEA
Thermopsis rhombifolia (Nuttall) Richardson
The clear yellow flowers of the goldenpea, as observed from the car windows, are very striking, and they are equally beautiful when seen close at hand. The plant’s suggestion of coarseness is less apparent when the blooms are gathered to adorn the house, and they do not fade so quickly as many of the daintier flowers.
Goldenpea has a rather wide range, extending from Colorado and Nebraska northward to Saskatchewan.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
