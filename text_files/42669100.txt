RED HELMET
Pedicularis bracteosa Bentham
Red helmet, or wood betony, is found plentifully in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and frequently, before it comes into bloom, deceives the passer-by, who assumes that its fern-like leaves are fern fronds. The flowers are curious in structure, the “helmet” having the shape of a walrus head with tusks on either side, and being so arranged that it protects the stamens from the rain. Insect visitors are plentiful, and gather the nectar easily from its shallow receptacles.
This member of the Figwort Family ranges from Colorado to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was gathered near Baker Lake, fifteen miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
