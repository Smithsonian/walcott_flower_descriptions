RED MAPLE
Acer rubrum Linnaeus
Red maple is our most showy tree of early spring. Its buds begin to develop with the first sunny days and the tree is soon covered with bloom. In autumn it is equally conspicuous, when its leaves, after the early frosts, turn a brilliant red. The red maple loves swamps and low grounds, and often borders woodlands. The tree is usually small or of medium size, but is reported, under exceptionally favorable conditions, to attain a height of 120 feet. The bark of old trees is rough and dark, but on young trees, smooth and gray. The light brown wood is used in the manufacture of furniture and of small turned articles.
Red maple ranges from Florida to Texas and northward to Nebraska, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.
The specimen sketched was found at Spring Lake, New Jersey.
