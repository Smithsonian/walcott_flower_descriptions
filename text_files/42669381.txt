BLUEBEAD
Clintonia borealis (Aiton) Rafinesque
Bluebead is found in cool, mossy, shady woods, where its handsome large green leaves draw attention to the greenish-yellow bellshaped flowers which are borne on a sturdy stem well above them. The large dark blue fleshy fruits, to which the common name refers, are more conspicuous than the flowers. They are held upright on their stiff stems, and are familiar to every nature lover who visits the northern woods in late summer. The Clintonias were named for DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, who was an enthusiastic botanist. They belong to the Lily Family.
This species has a wide range, occurring from the high mountains of North Carolina westward to Wisconsin and northward to Newfoundland and Minnesota.
The plant sketched was obtained near Canandaigua, New York.
