PALE LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium acaule Aiton
The pale ladyslipper is even lovelier than the common form of this beautiful orchid, which has pink flowers. The pale form is frequent in the North, but one who is so fortunate as to find it in the more southern part of its range, experiences a thrill that is not likely to be forgotten. If the soil is kept strongly acid, the plant will readily yield to culture in a wildflower garden, and will flourish in either dry or moist situations, and in sun or shade. A dressing of pine needles or oak leaves will help to conserve the moisture, as well as the acidity of the soil. No attempt should be made, however, to cultivate it in seer garden soil, for there it is sure to die.
The pale ladyslipper may be found from North Carolina and Tennessee northward to Manitoba and Newfoundland.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
