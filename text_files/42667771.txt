NAIAD SPRINGBEAUTY
Claytonia parvifolia Mociño
As we pick our way along some of the wet, stony trails near Glacier House, British Columbia, we find, if observing closely, the dainty stems of the naiad springbeauty, a member of the Purslane Family, growing from a small rosette of green leaves. This frail and delicate plant thrives in the cool drippings from the rocky banks. It is especially interesting from the fact that it propagates freely by bulblets from the axils of the stem leaves.
This plant ranges from Alaska southward in the mountains to California and Montana.
The specimen sketched was found near Glacier House in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
