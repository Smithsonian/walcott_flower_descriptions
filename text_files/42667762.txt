WHITE THISTLE
Cirsium hookerianum Nuttall
White thistles grow luxuriantly in the northern Rocky Mountains. Their seeds, readily blown about by the wind, embrace every opportunity to obtain a foothold. Along the motor road between Banff and Lake Louise they grow in great perfection, often four feet tall, with numerous flower heads along the straight stem, commonly culminating in a rosette of many heads at the apex. The tender opening flowers are much relished by the ponies, who do not seem to mind the prickly bracts and leaves. Above tree line the plants are reduced in size, often flowering when only six inches high.
The white thistle is distributed from Montana northward to the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and British Columbia.
Our specimen grew near the summit of Vermilion Pass, Alberta, on the motor road between Castle Station, on the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Columbia River Valley, at an altitude of 5,400 feet.
