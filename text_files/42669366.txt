WHITE GLOBEFLOWER
Trollius albiflorus (Gray) Rydberg
Alpine meadows, the wet margins of streams, and the edges of melting snow patches are the places most frequented by the white globeflower. It blooms so early in the season that it is usually in fruit before the eastern visitor arrives, though often retarded plants may be found in blossom even at the end of the summer, pushing through a thin sheet of ice at the border of an obstinate snowbank. The globeflower belongs to the Buttercup Family, and looks much like some of its cousins of that group, the anemones.
The range of this species is from Colorado to Washington, Alberta, and British Columbia.
We gathered it in the meadows near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
