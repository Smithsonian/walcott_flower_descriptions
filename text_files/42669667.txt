CATALINA MARIPOSA
Calochortus catalinae Watson
Catalina mariposa is a gay member of the genus Calochortus, of which more than forty varieties are found in California. Its flowers are delicately colored, their pearly petals marked with lavender. In favorable situations the plant may attain a height of two feet; in dry soil, although the stems are comparatively short, the flowers are still of normal dimensions, making them appear larger in proportion.
Catalina mariposa grows in southern California, and on the adjacent islands. It was described originally from Santa Catalina Island. The mariposas, members of the Lily Family, are most abundant on the Pacific coast, but they range eastward to the Rocky Mountains and southward to the highlands of central Mexico. About fifty species are known. The name mariposa is the Spanish word for butterfly, and the plants are often called mariposa lilies.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Santa Ana, California.
