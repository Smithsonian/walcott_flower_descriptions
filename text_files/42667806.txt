PINELAND ASTER
Aster squarrosus Walter
Some of the southern asters are very different in appearance from the common forms of the North, and one of the most curious is the pineland aster. It is common in many parts of Florida, growing in the sandy pine lands, which seem dry in winter, but are very wet in the rainy summer. The slender plants are one to two feet high, with stiff, brittle stems, which are usually much branched, and often form dense tangled masses. The most striking characteristic of this species is its minute leaves, which are extremely numerous, and spreading, or often reflexed. It flowers in autumn, like most asters, but continues in bloom throughout the winter.
The pineland aster ranges through most of Florida and northward to the coast of North Carolina.
