SMALL YELLOW LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium parviflorum Salisbury
The flowers of the small yellow ladyslipper, their golden pouches decked with streamers of bronze and claret, immediately attract us by their beauty, and we do not wonder that passing bees are enticed by the coloring and perfume of the flowers. Inside the yellow pouch are numerous fine hairs, which secrete tiny drops of a sticky fluid. The bee, attempting to escape, after she has been smeared with this substance, is forced by the shape of the pouch to crawl out by one of the narrow passages, on the sides of which the pollen masses and stigma are placed. In so doing the bee brushes first past the stigma and then the pollen-bearing anthers. She can not leave pollen on a stigma until she has been smeared with pollen from another flower, and thus cross fertilization is effected.
Fortunately this orchid is easily grown in a wild garden, requiring only a plentiful supply of humus in the soil.
The specimen sketched was found in North Carolina, but the plant ranges from Georgia to Newfoundland and westward to Missouri, Utah, and British Columbia.
