GREEN PYROLA
Pyrola chlorantha Swartz
The green pyrola is a denizen of dry wooded slopes, and blossoms in July. Although it has fewer flowers than the pink species, it is almost as attractive. The slightly sweet-scented flowers are borne on a stiff stem, rising from a rosette of leathery, evergreen leaves. The flowers are thick and fleshy and remain for a long time upon the plant, being followed by dry seed pods.
Green pyrola has a wide range, extending from Virginia to Arizona and California, and northward to Labrador and British Columbia. It occurs also in Europe.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
