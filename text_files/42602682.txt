PRAIRIE-SMOKE
Sieversia ciliata (Pursh) Don
This pretty and graceful plant grows in grassy meadows, where its red flowers, which resemble buds, its crimson stems, and plumed fruit immediately attract attention. In late summer the silky fruit heads give to dense patches of the plants dispersed over the plains, a purplish hazy appearance, when viewed from a distance.
The plant belongs to that group of the Rose Family which includes the cinquefoils and barren-strawberries, and is most nearly related to the geums, being in fact listed in some books as Geam triflorum.
As its name suggests, this plant is typical of the prairie region of the United States, ranging from New Mexico to Missouri and northward. It extends well up into the eastern valleys of the Rocky Mountains, as far north as Alberta, and has also migrated across southern Canada and the northern United States as far as Maine.
The specimen sketched was collected near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
