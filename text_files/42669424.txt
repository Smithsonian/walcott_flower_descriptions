CATESBY PITCHERPLANT
Sarracenia catesbaei Elliott
This pitcherplant was discovered by Mark Catesby, who explored the Carolinas in 1722, and was later named in his honor by Stephen Elliott, in his “Sketch of the Botany of South-Carolina and Georgia.” There is a difference of opinion among present-day botanists as to its status, some agreeing with Elliott that it is a distinct species, while others hold it to be a hybrid between Sarracenia flava and S. purpurea. It does combine the characters of the two presumptive parents in a striking way,—in the shape and position of the leaves, in the size of the flower parts, and especially in the petal color, which exhibits an attractive mingling of the yellow of the one species with the maroon of the other.
Catesby pitcherplant is reported to occur from Florida to North Carolina, although always rate and local. The specimen painted was grown in the Department of Agriculture greenhouses by Dr. Frederick V. Coville, the root having been collected by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry in a swamp near Quincy, Florida, in 1925. Dr. Wherry states that this plant grew in association with the two species of which it is supposed to be a cross, but that the adult clump was surrounded by seedlings in such a manner as to indicate that it is capable of reproducing itself, and is, accordingly, on the way to becoming an independent species.
