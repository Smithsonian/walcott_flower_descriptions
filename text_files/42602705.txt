PICKERELWEED
Pontederia cordata Linnaeus
On the flats bordering the Anacostia River in Washington, the rank growths of the various marsh plants form a broad belt of vegetation of striking appearance. Perhaps because of their color, the flowers of pickerelweed are not so conspicuous as those of some other members of the colony, but in spite of this its glossy green leaves, borne well above the surface of the water, and its ragged spikes of small blue or lavender flowers, continuing in bloom through most of the summer, are a delight to behold. Without a boat it is almost impossible to gather the blooms, growing from the soft mud that supports the outer phalanxes of aquatic plants. The flowers of the pickerelweed, which last but a single day, are in three forms. They do not produce seeds without the aid of insects, and it is an interesting study to examine them in detail with a glass and note the complicated structure by which they are able to obtain the greatest amount of benefit from their insect visitors. Giulio Pontedera, professor of botany at Padua about 1730, is commemorated by the generic name.
Pickerelweed is found from Florida to Texas and northward to Minnesota and Nova Scotia, and grows also in tropical America.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.
