TURTLEHEAD
Chelone glabra Linnaeus
This plant prefers to grow along water courses or in swamps, where it blooms freely in late summer and fall. The ingeniously constructed flower is visited by bees and other insects. The lower lip forms a platform on which the bees alight, and as the hooded upper lip is large enough to enclose the body of any but the largest kind of bees, they usually disappear completely when they go in to get the nectar. When they back out, their heads bear pollen brushed from the anthers, and in entering another blossom they leave some of this on the stigma, thus effecting cross-pollination. The creamy color of the flower, sometimes tinged with pink, turns to brown as it fades. Turtlehead is easily cultivated and forms a desirable addition to the wildflower garden. It belongs to the Figwort Family, and is often known to country folk as “wild snapdragon.”
Turtlehead has a wide range, occurring from Florida and Alabama to Kansas, and north to Newfoundland and Manitoba.
The plant from which the sketch was made grew on Mount Desert Island, Maine.
