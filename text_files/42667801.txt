LLOYDS STRAWBERRY-CACTUS
Echinocereus lloydii Britton and Rose
The brilliant cactus flowers of the southwestern United States are noticed by everyone traveling to California by train in the spring. At this season the apparently dead plants, often growing in grotesque shapes, are awakened by the first showers of the rainy season. Then the deserts are gorgeous with bloom, and colors in the artist’s box are inadequate to depict the various hues and shades of color in the myriads of flowers. The Cactus Family, embracing more than 1,200 species, is strictly American, although since the time of Columbus many of its members have been introduced into the Old World, where some of them have become serious pests.
This cactus is of limited range. It is found only in western Texas, where this specimen was collected.
