PRICKLY CURRANT
Ribes lacustre (Persoon) Poiret
Though never very abundant, the prickly currant is found in some regions of the Rocky Mountains in sufficient quantity to furnish a delightful dish. When stewed and eaten with venison or wild mutton, it makes a deliciously spicy sauce. When raw, the berries are rather sour, and are eaten only for want of something better.
Prickly currant may be found from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland and from California to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Glacier Lake, on the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
