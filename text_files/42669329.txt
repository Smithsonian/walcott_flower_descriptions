CAMAS
Quamasia quamash (Pursh) Coville
Camas is a relative of the lilies and hyacinths. It grows in large quantities in open meadows or boggy fields. When in bloom in early spring a camas meadow appears at a distance like a blue lake. The bulbs were used extensively as food by the northwestern Indians. When boiled they resemble potatoes in flavor. If baked over hot stones enclosed in a covering of grass for thirty-six hours they have a delicious chestnut flavor. Father de Smet in his “Oregon Missions” terms the bulb “the queen root of this clime.”
This lovely camas ranges from Utah, Montana, and northern California to British Columbia.
The sketch was made from plants growing at the east entrance to Glacier National Park, Montana.
