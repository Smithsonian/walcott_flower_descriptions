ELKSLIP
Caltha leptosepala De Candolle
The traveler seldom sees the beautiful elkslip in perfection, because it frequents retired spots high in the mountains. It grows in dense masses, preferring swampy meadows wet by the cold water from melting snow. The leaves suggest those of the cyclamen, but the flowers, with their yellow centers and white petals, are more like the flowers of bloodroot. Sometimes the petals are tinged outside with pale blue. They soon fall when the hot sun strikes them.
Elkslip has a wide range, occurring from New Mexico to Washington, Alberta, and British Columbia. It belongs to the Crowfoot Family and is closely related to the marshmarigolds of the East.
Near Mount Assiniboine, where this specimen was collected at an altitude of 5,000 feet, the alpine meadows in places are covered with its sturdy growth. Mount Assiniboine is fifty miles by trail south of Banff, Alberta, Canada.
