FRINGED GENTIAN
Gentiana crinita Froelich
Fringed gentian is a plant always surrounded with sentiment, which is reflected in Bryant's lines:
Thou waitest late, and comest alone
When woods are bare and birds have flown,
And frosts and shortening days portend
The aged seat is: meat his end.

Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye
Look through its fringes to the sky,
Blue—blue—-as if that sky let fall
A flower from its cerulean wall.
In some years the fringed gentian may be found growing plentifully in a given locality, but the next season it may be sought in vain in the same spot. The fact that the plant is a biennial, flowering only in its second season, sometimes accounts for this, although in some places other individuals come into bloom in the in-between years. The seeds, although numerous, are very small and light and easily washed away by rain or blown about by the wind. There are seven hundred members of the Gentian Family, most of them found in temperate and arctic regions, although many others grow in the higher mountains of tropical countries. The name is derived from that of King Gentius of Illyria.
Fringed gentian has a wide range, from the mountains of Georgia to Quebec and South Dakota.
The flowers sketched were obtained near Mount Kisco, New York.
