RABBITBEAN
Cracca virginiana Linnaeus
The gray-green foliage of the rabbitbean makes a delightful background for its straw-colored, pea-shaped flowers, touched with red, and crowded at the end of a stiff stem. The plant blooms in early summer and is to be found in dry, sandy, acid soil. Should you wish to gather a bunch, you will find the stems and the unusually long roots surprisingly tough, and a serviceable substitute for twine, if necessity demands. It is, indeed, commonly known in the South as devil's shoestring.
The seeds are in bean-shaped pods, which are frequently rifled by weevils, so that few of them ever teach maturity.
The Indians used a tropical American species of this genus as fish poison in the same manner in which they employed many other plants, throwing the macerated stems into quiet streams or ponds, with the result that the fish became stupefied and floated on the surface of the water, so that they were easily taken.
Rabbitbean ranges from Texas to Florida and northward to Manitoba and Ontario.
The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
