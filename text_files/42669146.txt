NODDING ONION
Allium cernuum Roth
In the Canadian Rockies, nodding onion is a conspicuous plant, growing plentifully on the drier slopes. Its graceful leaves and stems, the latter curved downward near the top, differentiate it from other members of the Lily Family. If its identification is in doubt, however, the smell and taste of garlic, when the stems are broken, enable one to place it at once.
This onion has a remarkably wide range, occurring from Virginia and New York to New Mexico and British Columbia.
We gathered it in the Ice River Valley, twenty miles by trail south of Leanchoil Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
