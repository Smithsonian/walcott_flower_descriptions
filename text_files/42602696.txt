PRICKLY CURRANT
Ribes lacustre (Persoon) Poiret
The prickly currant is a beautiful bush when in bloom. Its graceful branches are then ornamented with dainty racemes of yellowish flowers, shaded with red, and the delicate green leaves are of a tint best suited to show them off to perfection. When growing on a steep slope, with full exposure to the sun, the plant is so pleasing that one wonders why it has not been transplanted to cultivated gardens.
Prickly currant is found from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland and from California to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was collected on the slopes of Mt. Wapta, ten miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
