HAREBELL
Campanula rotundifolia Linnaeus
No one who has seen harebells remains unappreciative of their dainty beauty. The apparently delicate stems are really strong and well able to support the flowers they carry. The buds are usually upright, but the flowers when open are horizontal or turn downwards to protect the stamens and pistils from passing showers. The name rotundifolia (“round-leaf”) describes the basal leaves of the plant, which usually disappear before the flowers have developed.
The harebell has as wide a distribution as any member of the Bellflower Family, ranging from Pennsylvania to Illinois, New Mexico, and California, and north to Labrador and Alaska. It grows also in Europe and Asia. It is the Scotch bluebell or “bluebells of Scotland” that is celebrated in verse.
The sketch was made from specimens found near Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
