SPOTTED CYRTOPODIUM
Cyrtopodium punctatum (Linnaeus) Lindley
Few of the truly tropical orchids afford so brilliant a display of large and brightly colored flowers as does this plant, which is one of the showiest of all the orchids native in the United States. It grows abundantly in the cypress swamps of southern Florida, the huge plants with their large club-shaped pseudobulbs, often a foot long, forming dense clumps on the larger tree trunks. It is associated with smaller orchids, coarse ferns, bromeliads, and epiphytes of other groups. The graceful flower panicles, spreading or drooping from the tree trunks, are usually three feet long and sometimes much longer. The flowers, which recall those of the genus Oncidium, suggest a cloud of butterflies hovering over the foliage.
The spotted cyrtopodium has been in cultivation in England for a hundred years. Besides its occurrence in Florida, it has a wide range in the American tropics, extending through the West Indies and from Mexico to Brazil.
The specimen sketched was collected at Coot's Bay, Cape Florida, Florida.
