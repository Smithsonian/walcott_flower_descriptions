LOW WHORTLEBERRY
Vaccinium caespitosum Michaux
The low whortleberry, hidden among the grass, on gentle slopes of in alpine meadows, is unlike most other members of its group, for it grows only from three to seven inches tall. It has woody stems, much branched, and in spring bears a heavy load of lovely white or pink bells. These later develop into blue berries which are covered with an attractive bloom. The leaves turn a deep red color in autumn.
The low whortleberry may be found from New Hampshire to Labrador, and in the Rocky Mountains from Colorado to British Columbia and Alaska and westward to California.
We found the specimen sketched at Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise Station, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
