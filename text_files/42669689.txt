TRUMPETCREEPER
Bignonia radicans Linnaeus
Trumpetcreeper is a hardy vine with strong growth, and with gaudy red or orange flowers clustered at the ends of long, graceful stems. If it has an opportunity it clings by means of aerial roots to a supporting neighbor, and frequently it climbs to the tops of tall trees. If no support is available it is satisfied to grow in moist fields, or on neglected roadsides. It is especially beloved by humming birds, which poise below the blossoms and thrust their long, slender bills into the trumpets to reach the nectar glands at the base. Audubon, in painting the ruby-throat, shows the bird with this flower. The trumpetcreeper belongs to the Bignonia Family, whose name was given by Linnaeus in honor of Abbe Bignon, librarian to Louis XV. The genus, as restricted by some authors, contains but two known species, the other being a native of Japan. The crossvine of the Southern States is a near relative. The Bignonia Family is a large one, but most of its representatives are confined to the tropics.
Trumpetcreeper ranges from Florida and Texas northward to southern New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and lowa.
The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.
