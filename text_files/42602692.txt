LABRADOR-TEA
Ledum groenlandicum Oeder
Who that has traveled by the Canadian Pacific Railway in June, along the north shore of Lake Superior and across the boggy country traversed by that railroad, has not noticed the masses of low bushes covered with feathery heads of white flowers? When the mountains are reached we still find the shrub growing luxuriantly in full sunshine or adapting itself to more shaded situations, provided the ground is sufficiently wet. The margins of the leaves are rolled, and their under surface is covered with brown wool.
The leaves have an aromatic fragrance, and were used by the early settlers as a substitute for tea, but the beverage is rather too much like turpentine to be palatable.
Labrador-tea is one of the members of the Heath Family and is at home in northern regions. During the glacial period it probably survived near the margins of the ice sheets, and when these melted back, followed them closely and became widespread in the glaciated territory, wherever acid soils developed. It now grows from the highlands of New Jersey northward and westward far into the Rocky Mountains and the Arctic regions. It was in fact given the specific name groenlandicum because it was first discovered in Greenland.
The specimen sketched came from the White Mountains in New Hampshite.
