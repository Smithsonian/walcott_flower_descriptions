MARSHMARIGOLD
Caltha palustris Linnaeus
When the marshmarigold is in full bloom and the frogs are singing in chorus, we realize that spring has really come. The wet meadows and the margins of the brimming streams are then adorned with bunches of this beautiful Caltha, whose flowers seem of a more brilliant gold because of the contrast with their surroundings. The cluster of bright green leaves, from which the flower stems rise, adds to the charm of the plants. The leaves in spring are as good as spinach, when boiled as greens. The nectar is a feast for small bees and flies which visit the flowers in great numbers. The marshmarigold belongs to the Crowfoot Family. It is often erroneously called cowslip.
Marshmarigold has a wide range, and may be found from South Carolina to Newfoundland and west to Nebraska and Saskatchewan. It occurs also in the Arctic regions, as well as in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched grew near Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.
