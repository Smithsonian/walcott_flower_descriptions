FRANKLINIA
Franklinia alatamaha Marshall
Franklinia, or Franklin tree, a member of the Tea Family, has perhaps the most romantic history of any plant included in “North American Wild Flowers.” It was first seen by John Bartram in 1765 in the vicinity of Fort Barrington, Georgia, and was named by his friend, Humphrey Marshall, in honor of Benjamin Franklin. His son, William Bartram, also visited the locality in 1791, and described the plant in his “Travels through North and South Carolina.” He states that he never saw it at any other place but near the Fort, where “there are two or three acres of ground where it grows plentifully.” Thorough search has since been made by botanists, including Dr. C. S. Sargent, H. W. Ravenel, and Dr. E. T. Wherry, but no wild plants can be found. All those in existence in American gardens apparently originated with the plant or plants obtained by William Bartram and grown at Philadelphia in the place long known as Bartram’s Garden, now a public park.
Franklinia has been shown by Dr. Frederick V. Coville to belong to the great number of plants that flourish only in acid soils. Cuttings have been rooted successfully and distributed to nurserymen and to private gardens. At Whitesbog, in New Jersey, a number of plants are growing vigorously under the care of Miss Elizabeth C. White. The specimen sketched was obtained from one of these plants when they were in blossom in September, 1926. The delicious odor of the flowers attracts many bees, but few viable seeds have resulted. The Franklinia blooms in autumn when most other trees or shrubs are past flowering. Its leaves turn a beautiful crimson before falling from the branches.
