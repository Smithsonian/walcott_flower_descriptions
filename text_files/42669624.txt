WESTERN MOUNTAIN-ASH
Sorbus sambucifolia (Chamisso and Schlechtendal) Roemer
Western mountain-ash usually grows in stony places, beneath large trees of in openings in the forest. In especially favorable situations it sometimes develops into a tree 20 feet high. It is not a relative of the ashes, as its name would imply, but belongs to the Apple Family. The brilliant scarlet fruits, resembling miniature apples, are a favorite food of birds, especially in winter. The flavor of these fruits is not agreeable to the human palate, although when crushed in water they yield a subacid beverage that is not unpleasant. The small white flowers, which unfold in spring, are arranged in broad, flat-topped clusters. The buds, before expansion, are cream-colored. The open flowers are very sweet-scented.
A related European species is called rowan-tree or rowan.
This species of mountain-ash ranges from the southern Rockies of Arizona and New Mexico, northward to Alberta and Alaska. It is known also from Siberia.
The specimen from which the painting was made grew on the motor road near Vermilion Summit, about twelve miles from Castle Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
