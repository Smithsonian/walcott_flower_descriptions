CREEPING HOLLYGRAPE
Berberis repens Lindley
The shiny, prickly leaves of the hollygrape are so nearly like holly, that upon first glance we may think we have found that tree, reduced to a bush or low plant creeping over the ground. Closer inspection reveals many differences, for the berries, growing in a bunch, are of a lovely blue color-almost like small grapes-with plenty of bloom. They are rather pungent and sour to the taste, but are good for jelly or for making a refreshing drink, most welcome to quench the thirst when climbing a mountain side. As autumn approaches, the leaves change to red, either all over or around their borders, and are then most attractive in coloring. They remain upon the plant all winter.
Creeping hollygrape is found from California and New Mexico to Alberta and British Columbia. The Oregon hollygrape, Berberts aqusfolium, often known as Oregon grape, has been designated the State flower of Oregon, by vote of the legislature. Three species of hollygrape occur abundantly in the Pacific Northwest.
The specimen sketched was gathered in Sinclair Canyon, Columbia River Valley in British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
