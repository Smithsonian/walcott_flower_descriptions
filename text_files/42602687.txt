ARETHUSA
Arethusa bulbosa Linnaeus
The arethusa has a single large, one-sided flower with a delicate scent like that of fresh red raspberries. The recurved lip, with its fringes, forms a capital landing platform for visiting insects. As with many other orchids, the bees are frequent visitors to this plant. The flower is so constructed that the bee, in raising his head to depart after sipping the nectar, comes in contact with a few soft pellets of pollen, which are deposited upon his head from the helmet-shaped anther. Some of this pollen may be transferred to the stigmas of the next flower that he visits, although more often it is brushed off by other parts of the flower. Because of the infrequency of cross-pollination seeds rarely mature.
The name was given to the plant by Linnaeus, who recalled the myth of the nymph Arethusa, changed by Diana into a fountain, in order to protect her from the river god Alphaeus, who fell deeply in love with her on seeing her at her bath.
Owing to the great demand for this orchid by European collectors, it has been nearly exterminated in many sphagnum bogs where it formerly grew in great abundance.
Arethusa may be found from North Carolina northward to Maine and Newfoundland, and westward to Indiana and Minnesota.
The specimen sketched was obtained from a swamp a few miles east of Washington, District of Columbia, where the plant is extremely rare.
