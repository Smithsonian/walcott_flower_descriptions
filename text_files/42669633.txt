BUFF PUSSYTOES
Antennaria luzuloides Torrey and Gray
In the Rocky Mountain region over forty species of Antennaria, or pussytoes, are known, and many others grow in the Eastern States and along the Pacific Coast. They are members of the great Aster Family. In most of the species the plants have long, slender, leafy runners or sterile shoots, spreading over the ground in every direction to form dense mats, but such runners are absent in the species here illustrated. This is a slender erect plant, usually four to fifteen inches high. It grows on open, rocky or grassy slopes at middle altitudes in the mountains, or even above timber line. In many parts of the United States the species of Antennaria are known as Indian tobacco, and the leaves are chewed by children.
Buff pussytoes ranges from Wyoming and Montana westward to Oregon and British Columbia.
The specimen figured was obtained in the valley of the Siffleur River forty-five miles from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
