FRINGETREE
Chionanthus virginica Linnaeus
When the tender leaves of spring have developed so that the woods are just beginning to appear green, the blossoms of the fringetree present a great mass of feathery white, strikingly contrasting with the neighboring trees. The fringetree is a shrub or small tree belonging to the Olive Family, and a near relative of the ash. In the south it is commonly termed slawbush in reference to the long slender white corolla lobes. It is found in either swamps or exposed and often rather dry situations, being one of those interesting plants which are relatively indifferent to wetness or dryness so long as the soil possesses a fair degree of acidity. Our native species is often planted for ornament, but unless some care is taken to acidify its soil the leaves turn yellow by midsummer and fall in early autumn.
The fringetree ranges from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
