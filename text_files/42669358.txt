WHITE DAWNROSE
Pachyloplus marginatus (Nuttall) Rydberg
In the morning the dry sandy plains or mesas about Tucson are dotted with the beautiful white flowers of the dawnrose. About noon the blossoms close, and, turning pink in fading, they soon disappear, a new bud opening next morning. The petals are so ethereal in their delicate loveliness that it is hard to understand how they can spring from such an unfriendly dry soil.
White dawnrose ranges from Colorado, Utah, and Arizona to Idaho and Oregon.
The specimens sketched were gathered about forty miles south of Tucson, Arizona.
