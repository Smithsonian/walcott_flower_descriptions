RAGGED FRINGE-ORCHID
Habenaria lacera (Michaux) Loddiges
The tagged fringe-orchid comes into bloom a little later than its more showy sister, the yellow fringe-orchid. Because it grows in swampy places among grasses and other moisture-loving plants, or in deep woods, and since its flowers differ little in coloring from the leaves, it is not easily discovered. The stems are one to two feet high. The plant’s insect visitors are abundantly rewarded by the nectar which it supplies to them in exchange for the part they play in cross pollination. Owing to its color, it is more easily seen after dark than its yellow and purple relatives, and thus attracts night-flying moths to its feast.
Ragged fringe-orchid ranges from Georgia to North Carolina and Missouri, and northward to Newfoundland and Manitoba.
The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.
