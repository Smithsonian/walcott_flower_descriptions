SHOWY ORCHIS
Orchis spectabilis Linnaeus
Although this orchid is known by the English equivalent of its Latin name, showy orchis, the name is really not appropriate, for the plant is far less conspicuous than some of its North American relatives. It is known also as “pulpit-flower,” because of the resemblance of the mauve-colored arched petals to the sounding-board over a pulpit. In a walk through the deep woods in early spring, our feet rustling last year's fallen leaves, it is a pleasant surprise to chance upon a group of plants of this shy beauty, the earliest of the orchids to blossom.
The flower is well adapted to insure cross-pollination by bumblebees, for not only is the lip or lower petal of just the size to enable these insects to get a good hold upon it, but the spur, at the bottom of which the nectar is contained, is exactly equal in length to the bumblebee's tongue, so that smaller insects can not reach the nectar. Finally, the anther is so situated that while the bee is busily engaged in extracting the nectar, its head is smeared with the sticky pollen, and as the bee enters the flower of another plant, this pollen is rubbed off on the stigma, thus effecting cross-pollination. The waxy flowers are borne on a short stem, arising between two bright green leaves.
Showy orchis is found from Georgia to Arkansas, and northward to the Dakotas, Ontario, and New Brunswick.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
