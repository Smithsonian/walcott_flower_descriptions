DOUBLE BLADDERPOD
Physaria didymocarpa (Hooker) Gray
The hot sun of the long June days of northern latitudes soon develops the seed vessels of the double bladderpod, and the reason for the common name is then disclosed. When decorated with the many inflated seed pods the plant is unique in appearance and more conspicuous than when in bloom.
The genetic name Physaria is derived from a Greek word signifying bellows, in allusion to the form of the fruits. About six species of Physaria are known, all of them natives of western North America.
Double bladderpod ranges from Colorado to Utah and northward to Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The specimen sketched grew near Ptarmigan Pass, ten miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
