WESTERN GREEN ALDER
Alnus sinuata (Regel) Rydberg
Thickets of green alder are the bane of the mountaineer, for their hard, gnarled stems interlace to form an impenetrable tangle. On mountain sides, where, in early spring, snow slides have plunged down the steep slopes, weighing the alders to the ground, it is almost impossible to climb up against them. The rich green of their foliage combines well with their surroundings. The plant is especially interesting towards autumn, when a single branch may carry the remains of last year’s fruits as well as this year’s, and in addition the catkins ready for next year’s early display of flowers.
Western green alder belongs to the Birch Family, which contains some of the hardiest shrubs and trees. This species is found from Wyoming to California and northward to Alaska, and is especially abundant in the Selkirk Mountains.
The specimen sketched was gathered at Glacier, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
