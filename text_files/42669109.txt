MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK
Tsuga mertensiana (Bongard) Sargent
Mountain hemlock forms wide expanses of dark green foliage along the mountain sides. A mature tree has a tapering trunk two to four feet in diameter and seventy to a hundred feet in height, and gracefully drooping branches. The heavy cones are abundant and beautifully colored, especially in their earlier stages, before the scales have dried in ripening. In the Selkirk Mountains this is a conspicuous tree, adding greatly to the beauty of the landscape.
Mountain hemlock has a comparatively narrow range, occurring from western Montana to California and Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew near Glacier House, Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
