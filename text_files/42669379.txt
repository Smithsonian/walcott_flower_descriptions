YELLOW FRINGEORCHID
Habenaria ciliaris (Linnaeus) Robert Brown
Yellow fringeorchid is one of our showy representatives of the Orchid Family, and its only rival in brilliance of coloration in its accustomed habitat is the cardinalflower. The accepted common name is somewhat inappropriate, however, for its color is really of a decidedly orange hue. Growing two or three feet in height, in a ferny meadow or wet bog, or on the banks of a quiet stream, its bright orange color beckons the long-tongued butterflies and moths to visit it. In twilight it is easily seen by the large moths which hover over it; these are often mistaken for humming birds through the similarity in their manner of flight. It is a sturdy and elegant plant, and to find it growing in perfect development is a joy never to be forgotten.
Yellow fringeorchid has a wide range, from Florida to Texas and northward to Vermont, Ontario, and Michigan. It can be cultivated only in highly acid soil.
The sketch was made from plants gathered near Bridgeport, Connecticut.
