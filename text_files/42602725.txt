LAKE LOUISE ARNICA
Arnica louiseana Fatr
The horses had traveled a hard and stony way, very steep in places, for we were riding above timber line to visit an alpine lake tucked away in a glaciated cirque near the headwaters of the Clearwater River in British Columbia. There had been no trail to follow, except for the first half mile from camp, and we had reveled in the constant succession of wild gardens, filled with mountain flowers in the perfection of bloom, through which we were passing. Many of the plants were crushed by the feet of the ponies, and we were continually on the watch for new varieties. A long grassy slope facing north was being conquered, when several yellow flowers appeared, quite different from any we had seen before in the mountains. Upon closer examination they were recognized as the rare Lake Louise arnica, a composite found only in the Canadian Rockies. The best specimens were carefully gathered, carried to camp, and sketched without delay, but the thrill of seeing them in their native habitat will always be recalled with delight.
