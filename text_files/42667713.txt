SHOWY OXYTROPE
Oxytropis splendens Douglas
Showy oxytrope is one of the most attractive members of the Pea Family. The graceful stems hold the flower spikes well above the silky leaves, which form a tufted mass about the roots. The gray-green leaves contrast pleasingly with the purple flowers. Some authors use the genus name Aragallus instead of Oxytropis. Though this is properly a prairie plant, it is found frequently in the lower valleys on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
Showy oxytrope ranges from Minnesota to Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Yukon.
The specimen sketched was gathered in the Bow Valley, fifteen miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
