RAMSHEAD LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium arietinum Robert Brown
Ramshead ladyslipper is the rarest of the North American species of Cypripedium, and one of the most unusual in form and color. It is much daintier than its sisters in its habit of growth. It occurs only in cold, damp woods, and happy is he who is fortunate enough to find it. 
Ramshead ladyslipper grows from Massachusetts and New York to Minnesota and northward to Quebec and Manitoba.
The specimen sketched was obtained in Chittenden County, Vermont, by Mr. Edwin Hale Lincoln of Pittsfield, Massachusetts.
