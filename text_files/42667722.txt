WILD CALLA
Calla palustris Linnaeus
Calla is an ancient name taken from Pliny. Our wild plant, the only species of the genus, belongs to the same family as the showy greenhouse plant, to which the name calla is applied commonly. Growing in bogs, and along the borders of sluggish streams, the bright green leaves of the wild calla mingle with those of other bog plants, and not until the plant comes into bloom, and the white spathe appears, are we attracted to it. Large numbers of small flies and midges visit the flowers. Wild calla is a member of the Arum Family, a vast group, most of whose representatives are inhabitants of tropical forests. It should be noted that in the case of our plant, as in other members of the family, what appears to be a blossom is really a spike of many small and inconspicuous flowers, surrounded by a showy corolla-like envelope or spathe. Wild calla ranges from New Jersey to lowa and Wisconsin, and northward to Nova Scotia, Hudson Bay, and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was obtained west of Sudbury on the Canadian Pacific Railway in Canada.
