WHITE PEA
Lathyrus ochroleucus Hooker
The white pea is rank in growth when it finds a congenial situation, clambering over the undergrowth, and giving a delicate touch to the heavier shrubs by its graceful appearance and fresh color. Horses like it, especially when in bloom, or when the seed pods have formed. We found it in greatest perfection in July on the banks of Lake Minnewonka near Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet. The plants attach themselves for support to other objects in the same manner as the garden pea, by threadlike tendrils borne at the ends of the leaves.
White pea ranges from New Jersey westward to Wyoming, and northward to Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia.
