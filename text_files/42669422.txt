SCARLET GLOBE-MALLOW
Sphaeralcea grossulariaefolia (Hooker and Arnott) Rydberg
Scarlet globe-mallow is one of the showy plants of the Arizona mesas and river valleys, where often it grows in great abundance. The flowers commonly are scarlet, but they are equally handsome when of a paler hue. They are produced in spikelike panicles on the upper part of stems so weak that they bend gracefully before the wind. By the Mexicans the plant is called malojo, “eye-bane,” because the small, branched, starlike hairs on the leaves and stems adhere to the fingers in handling, and if brushed into the eyes, cause irritation and pain.
This brilliant member of the Mallow Family is very common in Arizona, and ranges northward to Idaho and Wyoming.
The specimen sketched was gathered near the Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution at Tucson, Arizona.
