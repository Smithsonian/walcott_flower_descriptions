PINE LAND BLUEBERRY
Vaccinium tenellum Aiton
Pineland blueberry is a low shrub, rarely over three feet high. It has long, slender, woody underground stems, from which rise at irregular intervals the stiff, bushy branches. The flowers open in early spring, before the finely toothed leaves are fully expanded. The edible berries are a quarter of an inch in diameter, and black, with a whitish bloom over their surface.
Pineland blueberry ranges from Florida to Virginia and westward to Mississippi. It is a shrub of the Coastal Plain, and grows chiefly in sandy pine woods.
The sketch was made from specimens collected at Beaufort, South Carolina.
