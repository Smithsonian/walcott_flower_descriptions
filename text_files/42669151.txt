PRAIRIE THISTLE
Cirsium undulatum (Nuttall) Sprengel
We rarely saw the prairie thistle in perfection. Our horses grazed on the mountain side back of our camp, and every plant to which they had access was denuded of its flowers as soon as they opened. Fortunately, a wire fence protected the garden at Radium Hot Springs, and under this protection we found a good specimen.
The plant is a picturesque one. The large purple flowers are very sweet and attract many insects to their feast of nectar. The leaves are very prickly and much waved, so that it is sometimes called wavyleaved thistle. We marveled that the apparently tender lining of the horses mouths was not injured by the stiff prickles. Prairie thistle ranges from Michigan to Arizona and British Columbia.
The sketch was made from a plant that grew near Radium Hot Springs in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
