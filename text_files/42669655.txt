MOUNTAIN CRANBERRY
Vaccinium vitisidaea minus Loddiges
There is a striking contrast between the deep green of mountain cranberry leaves and the dainty bunches of white bells at the tips of the woody stems. The sweet-scented flowers are frequently tinged with pink. The plant, like other members of the Blueberry Family, delights in acid soil.
Mountain cranberry grows neatly throughout the colder parts of North America, occurring rarely in New England and. southern Canada, but becoming a common plant in high mountain and Arctic lowland regions. It presumably survived the glacial period on some of the non-glaciated islands, and when the ice retreated it rapidly occupied the devastated territory, its seeds being widely dispersed by birds. The typical form of the species is similarly distributed in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was obtained on the shores of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
