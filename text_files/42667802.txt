GHOSTPIPE
Thalesia uniflora (Linnaeus) Britton
Ghostpipe is one of the strange plants parasitic on the roots of various herbs. It frequents dry or moist woodlands, and is one of our spring flowers. Like other similar parasitic plants, it lacks chlorophyll, and hence all green coloration. The foliage, too, is greatly reduced, the leaves being represented by a few inconspicuous scales. The plant belongs to the Broomrape Family. Some botanists use the name Aphyllon instead of Thalesia.
Ghostpipe occurs from South Carolina and Texas northward to Newfoundland and Ontario.
The specimen sketched grew on Plummers Island, near Washington, District of Columbia.
