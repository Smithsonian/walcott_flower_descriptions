ALBERTA PRIMROSE
Primula maccalliana Wiegand
Travelers to the mountains in midsummer rarely see this lovely primrose, for it soon passes with the first warm days. It delights in wet banks or moist, sandy or gravelly places, and is so small that sharp eyes are needed to find it. The slender, dainty stem carries the pale pink flowers four or five inches above the basal tuft of green leaves, from whose center they spring. The flowers become purple in withering.
Alberta primrose has a narrow range, occurring only in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was found on the shore of Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
