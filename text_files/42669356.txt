ARROWLEAF GROUNDSEL
Senecia triangularis Hooker
Arrowleaf groundsel is a common plant which blooms late in the season in the Canadian Rockies. It likes the rich soil of the borders of alder thickets, where the brittle stems are somewhat protected from the wind, and other moist places. It is a lush, coarse plant whose yellow flowerheads give a gay color note in contrast to the bright green leaves.
The genus Senecio belongs to the Aster Family, and comprises at least twelve hundred species found in many parts of the world. They are widely distributed over the North American continent. This species ranges from New Mexico and California north to Saskatchewan and Alaska.
We gathered the specimen sketched near Evelyn Glacier, twenty-five miles from Castle, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
