ROSEBAY RHODODENDRON
Rhododendron maximum Linnaeus
The glory of the rosebay rhododendron when in bloom can hardly be exaggerated. Its lovely white or delicately pink flower clusters, surrounded by dark green leaves, make a charming picture. The shrub grows to a height of thirty feet in the Carolina mountains, where it often covers every available spot, both swamp and hillside, with a tangle of stiff stems and leathery foliage. The mountaineers know it as “laurel.” Its roots lie in mats close to the surface of the ground, and are protected by a cover of fallen leaves, which conserve the moisture, retain the acid condition of the soil, and add fertility.
Rosebay rhododendron is the state flower of West Virginia. It is abundant from central Georgia and Alabama as far north as Pennsylvania. It is occasional farther north, even reaching one or two localities in Nova Scotia.
The specimen sketched was obtained from the mountains of North Carolina.
