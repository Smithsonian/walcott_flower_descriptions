GREEN BEARCABBAGE
Veratrum viride Aiton
Wherever green bearcabbage grows, it is always a conspicuous plant, in spite of the fact that its flowers are scarcely different in color from the foliage. In the West it loves the moist, rich soil of mountain meadows and valleys. The leaves are strongly veined and have a plaited appearance. The plant is coarse and tall, the flower panicles often rising five feet above the ground. The sturdy shoots of this plant push through the soil when the earliest spring flowers unfold, as soon as the snow has melted, and at that time its fresh green color is most attractive. It belongs to the Bunchflower Family and, like some of its near relatives, is poisonous. The poison is chiefly in the root, however, and when there is a shortage of other forage, animals often graze on bearcabbage without ill effect.
Green bearcabbage is found over much of the cooler parts of North America from Virginia to Tennessee and Oregon, and northward.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained in the Bow Valley, thirty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
