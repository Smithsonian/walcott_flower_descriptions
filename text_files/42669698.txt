PURPLE BUTTERWORT
Pinguicula elatior Michaux
Purple butterwort is a dainty and beautiful plant. It grows in moist sandy pine woods on the Coastal Plain, often in association with other purple or yellow butterworts. Although in Florida it may be found in flower at almost any season, it blooms most profusely in spring. The solitary flower is poised at the top of a slender stalk springing from the center of a rosette of pale green leaves, which usually lie flat against the sand. They feel greasy to the touch because they are covered with myriads of minute glands. The exudation from the glands entraps small insects which alight on the leaf surface, and these helplessly entangled creatures are held closely by the inrolled margins of the leaf blade, to be digested and assimilated as food. The butterworts are all terrestrial plants, but they belong to the same family as the bladderworts, many of which are aquatic.
This species of butterwort is common in Florida and adjoining States, but appears to be unable to withstand cold weather. It has not migrated farther north than southern North Carolina. Curiously enough one of its close relatives is intolerant of warm climates, and though occurring through much of Canada, has not reached farther south than central New York.
The specimen sketched was brought into flower in the greenhouses of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, from specimens obtained in Florida.
