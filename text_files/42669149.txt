WESTERN CRANESBILL
Geranium viscosissimum Fisher and Meyer
Western cranesbill is a more robust plant than its relative, the wild geranium, which is so common in the Eastern woods in spring. The flowers are borne on sturdy stems well above the beautiful cluster of rich green leaves, making the plant almost a bouquet in itself. The name cranesbill comes from the resemblance of the seed pod to the bill of a crane.
Western cranesbill belongs to the Geranium Family. It is found from Colorado and California northward to South Dakota, Alberta, and British Columbia.
We gathered the flowers in a beautiful meadow, a day and a half by trail northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
