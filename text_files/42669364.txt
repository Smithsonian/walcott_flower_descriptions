PTARMIGANBERRY
Arctous alpina (Linnaeus) Niedenzu
This dwarf shrub of the Heath Family is a colorful plant in autumn when its leaves turn crimson and it is decorated with red berries. Growing flat on the ground, it makes brilliant patches of color under the willows, alders, and scrub pines which form open thickets over the shaly flats deposited by glacial streams. By some authorities the red-berried form here pictured is separated as a variety from the more widespread black-berried one. Under the name Arctous erythrocarpa or Arctous alpina rubra, the ptarmiganberry grows at high altitudes in widely separated districts of Maine, New Hampshire, and Greenland, and from British Columbia to Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.
The plant was especially beautiful in Douglas Canyon Valley, which leads from Red Deer River Valley, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, where we found it at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
