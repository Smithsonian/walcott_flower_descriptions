PRAIRIE PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon erianthera Pursh
Prairie pentstemon is one of a large genus of plants, embracing about one hundred and forty species, all of which are natives of North America. Wherever present they are likely to be found in great numbers, especially in the West, where they are very conspicuous. This species grows in small clumps on dry hillsides. Its large flowers are wonderfully varied in coloration, ranging from blue, through various shades of dull purple, to pale pink. They belong in the Figwort Family.
The prairie pentstemon may be found from Nevada, Nebraska, and North Dakota to British Columbia and Washington.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Sinclair Hot Springs, in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at an elevation of 2,500 feet.
