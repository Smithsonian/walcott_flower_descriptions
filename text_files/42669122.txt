GOLDEN FLEABANE
Erigeron aureus Greene
Golden fleabane is known to all mountaineers in the Canadian Rockies, for its clear yellow flowers cover the ground in favorable situations above tree line, or appear in rock crevices where the soil has gathered in sufficient quantity to give the plants a foothold. The flowers spring from a tuft of gray-green leaves, and are raised by their tiny stems an inch or more above the ground. They are not so perishable as most alpine flowers, and may be found through most of the season. They belong to the Aster Family.
Golden fleabane has a narrow range, being found only in Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained on the summit of Mount Fairview, near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 8,500 feet.
