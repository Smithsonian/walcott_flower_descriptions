YELLOW DRYAD
Dryas drummondii Richardson
When the flowers of yellow dryad are past, their stalks lengthen and soon the twisted seed heads develop into balls of fluff. These are borne on dainty stems about six inches above the close mats of graygreen leaves. Near Glacier Lake they grew in fairy rings. The soft pink fluffy fruits were very beautiful. The horses considered them only from the practical standpoint, and enjoyed eating them.
This member of the Rose Family is found in the mountains from Quebec to Montana, British Columbia and Alaska.
In the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, by trail, the plant grew in abundance, and here we obtained these specimens at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
