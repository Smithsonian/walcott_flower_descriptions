BUSH CINQUEFOIL
Potentilla fruticosa Linnaeus
Bush cinquefoil is one of the showiest plants of the Canadian Rockies, where it seems to find congenial surroundings almost everywhere, flourishing in alpine meadows or on mountain slopes,and sometimes at high elevations, struggling against the mountain winds and other adverse conditions to obtain a foothold. In midsummer it is covered with clear yellow flowers, which appear to greater advantage by reason of the silver-gray foliage that forms their background. In moist limestone soils in New England it is classed as a weed, because of its invasion of idle fields and pastures.
This member of the Rose Family is found from California, New Mexico, and New Jersey northward to Alaska, central Canada, and Labrador, as well as in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was collected on the trail below Burgess Pass, six miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
