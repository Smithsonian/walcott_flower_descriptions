CANADA LILY
Lilium canadense Linnaeus
The habit of the Canada lily is striking, for it rises above its surrounding meadow companions, its tall, stout stem decorated with regular whorls of bright green leaves, from the uppermost of which the flower stalks spring, the flowers drooping in a circle around them. The pendent position of the flowers shelters the pollen-laden anthers from the summer showers, and sometimes the bees take refuge from the rain under their golden caps. This species grows in richer woods than its relative, the American turkscap lily, and varies in color from the yellow here shown to a rather bright red.
Canada lilies are found from Georgia and Alabama to Missouri, and northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Nebraska.
The specimen sketched was found near Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.
