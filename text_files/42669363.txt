HOODED LADIES-TRESSES
Ibidium strictum (Rydberg) House
Hooded ladies-tresses is later in blooming than most of our native orchids, and often delays flowering until the end of summer. It grows in moist or swampy places, in low meadows or near the borders of streams. It is a very sweet-scented plant and is often abundant where congenial soil and moisture conditions exist. Cross-pollination of the flowers is insured by their intricate structure, and bees carry the pollen from one flower to another. Darwin's interesting observations on this process have been recorded in great detail, and he and Asa Gray had an extensive correspondence upon the subject.
The plant has a wide range, extending in one form or another from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland, New Mexico, California, and Alaska. Perhaps more than one species is included in this citation of range, as those from the east and from the west look rather dissimilar.
The flowers sketched were obtained in the Siffleur River Valley, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
