ZENOBIA
Zenobia cassinifolia (Ventenat) Pollard
Zenobia is a branching shrub, from three to five feet in height, with glossy, deep green leaves. Its clusters of large, creamy-white, bell-shaped flowers exhale a delightful perfume, and its name is a fitting tribute to the beautiful Zenobia, queen of Palmyra, in the days of its glory. The plants flourish in acid soil, like most other members of the Heath Family, to which the genus belongs.
Zenobia ranges from Florida to North Carolina, in the coastal plain and piedmont provinces, but it has proved hardy much farther north.
The sketch was made from specimens obtained near Rose Hill, North Carolina.
