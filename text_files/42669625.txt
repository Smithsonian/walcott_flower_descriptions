PLUME ANEMONE
Pulsatilla occidentalis (Watson) Freyn
Those whose fancy has led them in spring or summer to the higher parts of the Canadian Rocky Mountains have been thrilled with the loveliness of this beautiful anemone as it springs up at the edges of retreating snow banks on the alpine slopes and valleys. The flowers begin to open when the stems are only an inch high and still nestle in a mass of grayish-green furry buds and half unfolded leaves. Within a few days the stems lengthen, and each bears a large, creamy flower with golden and green center, the blossoms contrasting with the background of pale green foliage. As they fade the flowers are sometimes tinged with blue.
The plume anemone belongs to the Crowfoot Family. It ranges from California and Montana northward to Alberta and Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew near Lake O'Hara, fifteen miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
