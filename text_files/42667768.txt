SWEETVETCH
Hedysarum mackenzii Richardson
In but one place that we visited in the Canadian Rockies did we find sweetvetch growing in perfection. For several seasons we have made “Wild Flower Camp” our headquarters for a short time. On the trail passing from that place up the steep slopes to the divide above the head of Johnson Creek, we came to a deep unnamed alpine lake, along whose rocky shore the trail leads. On the slopes above the trail, where the glaciers have plowed away the mountain side, leaving stretches of upland meadows between the rocks, the disintegrating limestone provides ideal soil conditions for leguminous plants. Here sweetvetch grows in clumps, with stems stiff enough to support the heavy blossoms, while the luxuriant growth of leaves forms a fine background for the flowers. These are of various shades of crimson and pink, or occasionally pure white, and their scent is as delightful as that of freshly gathered sweet peas from the home garden. In other localities the flower heads are so heavy that the stems lie prostrate on the ground, making beautiful rosettes sometimes eighteen inches across. Alexander Mackenzie, in his journey of discovery down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1793, used the roots of sweetvetch as an emergency food.
This plant is restricted to the Canadian Rocky Mountain region, from Alberta to Northwest Territory and Yukon.
The unnamed lake is about ten miles northeast of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, but by the circuitous trail one and a half days are required. The altitude is about 8,000 feet.
