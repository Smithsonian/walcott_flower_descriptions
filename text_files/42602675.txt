TRUMPET HONEYSUCKLE
Lonicera sempervirens Linnaeus
While tramping through open woods or along streams in low ground, the attention may be attracted toa bit of red color quite in contrast to the brown leaves and gray tree trunks or low-growing bushes. Closer inspection reveals the gray stems that lead to the leafy shoots above, where the delicate trumpet-shaped flowers are clustered at the ends of the branches. Few vines are more attractive; the plant seems to poise itself in the most graceful way as it climbs from one supporting shrub to another.
The flower is a great favorite with humming birds, which frequently are seen probing the trumpets to obtain the delicious nectar to be found in them.
The fruit is a brilliant scarlet berry. The plant is a great addition to any wild garden.
Trumpet honeysuckle ranges from Texas to Florida, and northward to Nebraska, its northern limit being reached in New York and southern New England.
The specimen sketched was collected at Yemassee, South Carolina.
