SOUTHERN COAST VIOLET
Viola septemloba Le Conte
This southern plant is one of our most showy violets, with larger blossoms than most of its northern relatives. It grows in light, acid soil, often in nearly pure sand, and is found in pine barrens from Mississippi and Florida northward to southeastern Virginia. The leaves exhibit unusual variation in the number and shape of their lobes, so that judging from leaf shape alone, one would often assume that several species were represented in a single colony of the plants, were it not for the fact that the form of flowers and seed pods is so uniform.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected in North Carolina, and brought into flower in the greenhouses of the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.
