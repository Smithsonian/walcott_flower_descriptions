MENZIES PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon menziesii Hooker
While we were driving along the motor road in Rainier National Park near Paradise Valley, our attention was attracted by a conspicuous outcrop of gray rock. Near the top of this broken rock-pile appeared clumps of pink flowers, which proved to be the pentstemon named in honor of the Scotch explorer Menzies. The lovely flowers appear to best advantage when growing in crevices with the gray rocks behind them.
The pentstemons belong to the Figwort Family. This species is found only in Washington and British Columbia.
