AMERICAN TWINFLOWER
Linnaea borealis americana (Forbes) Rehder
This dainty plant, named for Linnaeus, the father of modern botany, in accordance with his own choice, by his friend Gronovius, is unsurpassed in modest beauty. It is a trailing evergreen vine, from whose slender branches rise threadlike stems, each beating two nodding flowers. These are so sweet-scented that the odor sometimes penetrates even into a railroad train passing along a mountain side when the plant is in bloom. It loves the deep recesses of the forest, where it thrives with moss and other plants that demand acid soils. Perhaps this tiny blossom was the inspiration of Linnaeus when he said of the unfolding flowers, “I saw God in his glory passing near me, and bowed my head in worship.”
The twinflower belongs to the Honeysuckle Family. It has a wide range, the American form, which is only slightly different from that of the Old World, being distributed from New Jersey to New Mexico and northward to Greenland and Alaska. The typical form grows in Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
