SWEET AZALEA
Azalea arborescens Pursh
The sweet azalea is one of the contributions to our flora from the Appalachian Mountains, where so many attractive plants were found by the early botanists. Its delightfully fragrant, spicy, white flowers appear in June when the leaves are well developed and afford a fine green background for the blossoms. The foliage often turns brilliant red in late autumn.
The plant loves a well drained, deep, moist, acid soil, and under favorable conditions becomes a spreading clump, which blooms freely. It is perhaps the largest of our native azaleas, occasionally attaining a height of twenty feet.
Sweet azalea occurs in the mountains from Georgia northward into Pennsylvania.
The sketch was made from a plant found in the vicinity of Linville, North Carolina, at the foot of Grandfather Mountain.
