SHORTSPUR COLUMBINE
Aquilegia brevistyla Hooker
Shortspur columbine is a rate member of the Crowfoot Family, seldom found by mountain visitors. Its blue coloring is most beautiful, and in marked contrast to that of the lemon columbine and red columbine, both of which are familiar plants in the alpine valleys of the Canadian Rockies.
This species is found from Minnesota and South Dakota to Alberta and Yukon. It is closely related to the European columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) so often cultivated in our gardens.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained in the valley of Healy Creek, ten miles south of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
