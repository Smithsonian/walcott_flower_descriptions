CLUSTERLILY
Hookera pauciflora (Torrey) Tidestrom
The Desert Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington is located near Tucson, Arizona, high up on a small desert mountain notable for its profusion of cactuses and other strange plants which are able to exist with a minimum of water. Among the sun-baked rocks grow many clusterlilies, which are always attractive in their dainty beauty. Their bulbs, sunk deep in soil, enable the plant to live from one blooming season to another.
The genus of the Lily Family to which clusterlily belongs contains many species restricted to Western North America, and occurring mainly in California, but the present species grows in Arizona and New Mexico. The technical name of this genus was given in honor of Sir William Jackson Hooker, one of the most eminent of English botanists.
