OCONEE-BELLS
Shortia galacifolia Torrey and Gray
This evergreen, ground-coveting plant was for many years one of America’s “lost species”. It had been discovered by Michaux, the French botanist, during his travels in the mountain wilderness of North Carolina in 1788, but the exact spot where he found it long remained unknown, and the dried specimen he had collected, preserved in Paris, was the only proof that such a plant existed. In 1877 the plant was rediscovered, and subsequently found to be fairly abundant in a few restricted areas. I have not seen it in the wild, but Dr. Edgar T. Wherry informs me that it thrives in acid soils on steep slopes along shaded mountain brooks, and that the primroselike white flowers, starring the mats of winter-bronzed foliage in March, produce a charmingly beautiful effect. If transplanted into ordinary garden loam it soon dwindles and dies, but if given acid humus soil it is not hard to grow in cultivation. Oconee-bells is known to the mountaineers as the one-flower coltsfoot, but the common name has been given from its abundance in the Oconee Valley.
Oconee-bells is known to grow only in the Blue Ridge and adjoining parts of the Piedmont region in North and South Carolina. A close relative occurs in Japan, however, indicating that before the glacial period the genus must have spread over both northeastern Asia and northern North America. The ice advances no doubt exterminated some of the species, but the two that chanced to migrate far enough to the southward of the line reached by the ice sheets were preserved.
The specimen painted was grown by Dr. Frederick V. Coville, in acid peat-sand soil, in a greenhouse of the United States Department of Agriculture at Washington.
