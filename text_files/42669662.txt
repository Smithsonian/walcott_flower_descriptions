BUFF MONKEYFLOWER
Diplacus longiflorus Nuttall
Buff monkeyflower is a plant of pleasing appearance. Its brightly colored flowers, borne in profuse clusters, are set off by their background of bright green foliage. This monkeyflower is a shrub, one to three feet high, delighting in the steep slopes of canyons, which are usually well drained. It is a sticky plant, and somewhat unpleasant to handle. Transplanted to garden soil, it grows more vigorously, and well repays the attention of the flower lover.
Buff monkeyflower grows in the southern half of California and in northern Lower California, at altitudes of 500 to 5,000 feet. It is a member of the Figwort Family, and by some botanists is placed in the genus Mimulus.
The specimen sketched was found about ten miles from Los Angeles, California.
