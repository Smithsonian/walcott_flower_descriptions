ALEUTIAN FLEABANE
Erigeron unalaschensis (De Candolle) Rydberg
The alpine valleys of the Canadian Rocky Mountains are wonderful places in which to find wild flowers that flourish in high altitudes. Among these the Aleutian fleabane, a member of the great Aster Family, deserves a prominent place. It delights in the moist earth near snow-water streams, being able to withstand the violent, almost daily changes from warm sunshine to freezing temperatures. The dainty plant often has a woolly covering to protect it.
This fleabane is found from Montana to Alaska as well as in Labrador and Greenland.
The specimens sketched were gathered in the Little Yoho Valley, fifteen miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
