PINK TWISTEDSTALK
Streptopus curvipes Vail
In the moist recesses of the woods in the Selkirk Mountains are found beds of pink twistedstalk. The bell-shaped, dainty, rose-colored flowers hang beneath the clear green leaves on slender stalks that spring from the leaf axils. Thus the passer-by does not see them, unless he knows where to search for the hidden flowers. The plant usually has unbranched stems and grows from a foot to two feet in height, forming extensive colonies in favorable places. It is a relative of the lily-of-the-valley of our gardens. The fruit is a round, red, inedible berry.
The species ranges from Oregon and British Columbia to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Glacier House at Glacier Station in the Selkirk Mountains, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
