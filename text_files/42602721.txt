ANEMONELLA
Syndesmon thalictroides (Linnaeus) Hoffmannsegg
Anemonella, often called rue-anemone, frequents open woods, where it is found in company with hepatica and bloodroot when the first warm days of spring call sleeping plants to awaken. The slender stems, bearing the fragile green leaves and delicate pink or white flowers, grow from a cluster of small tuberous roots. These hold so lightly to the soil that they are easily pulled up, unless care is taken in plucking the flowering stems. Anemonella, the only member of its genus, resembles somewhat its relatives, the true anemones or windflowers, but differs in having the flowers in clusters, and the leaves divided into rounded leaflets. It yields readily to cultivation and is a teal desideratum for the wildflower garden.
Anemonella is a wide-ranging species, extending from Florida to New Hampshire and westward to Kansas and Minnesota.
The specimen sketched was found at Washington, District of Columbia.
