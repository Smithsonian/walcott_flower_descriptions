HAZEL ALDER
Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Sprengel
The alders are widespread shrubs known to all who welcome the coming of spring. With the exception of the skunkcabbage, their blooms are the earliest forerunners of spring, and almost every swamp and sheltered brook where the sun can penetrate is decorated with numerous bushes, hung with purple and yellow pendent catkins. The pollen, furnished by these in large quantities, is blown by the wind, lighting on the little green or purplish knobs of pistillate flowers, which grow into ripe cones in autumn. Several species of the genus Alnus contain in their bark a coloring principle of value, dyeing either yellow or orange. With copperas added, a good black may be made from it. Before the coming of the white man with his commercial colors, alder dye was frequently used by the Indians.
There are several species of alder in the United States, the one here represented ranging from Florida to Texas and from Maine to Minnesota.
The sketch was made from a specimen gathered near Washington, District of Columbia.
