RED BUCKEYE
Aesculus pavia Linnaeus
The red buckeye is a straggling, inconspicuous shrub in the southern woods until it comes into bloom, when it immediately attracts attention by its bright red flowers which are borne in a loose spike. The stems of the new growths also are red at blooming time, and the tender green leaves with their red stems make an appropriate setting for the flower spikes. It is usually a shrub three or four feet high, but in favorable situations it sometimes attains tree size, although never approaching the stature of its relatives, the Ohio buckeye and the horsechestnut.
Red buckeye is a southern species, ranging from Texas to Florida, and extending northward as far as southern Missouri and southeastern Virginia.
The specimen sketched was collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.
