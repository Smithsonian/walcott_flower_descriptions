WOOD MERRYBELLS
Uvularia perfoliata Linnaeus
Wood merrybells, a graceful and attractive plant belonging to the Lily-of-the-valley Family, is common in rich, moist woods in May or June. The flowers hang singly on a slender stem. So many more striking flowers are in bloom at the same season that the species of merrybells are easily overlooked.
The specimen sketched was found near Rock Creek Park, Washington, District of Columbia, but the plant ranges from Georgia, Tennessee, and Kansas northward to Quebec, Ontario, and Minnesota.
