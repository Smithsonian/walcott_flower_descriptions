RIVERBANK GENTIAN
Gentiana affinis Grisebach
The riverbank gentian prefers the flat borders of streams in the lower valleys, where grasses and sedges find a combination of congenial soil and moisture. The purple flowers, with white marking on the petals, are elusive, since they are often hidden by neighboring plants. We found them near a “lick” where twenty mountain sheep, ewes and lambs, were enjoying the salty soil kept moist by the snow water from the rushing river near by, which overflowed its banks each August afternoon.
The riverbank gentian, placed by some botanists in the genus Dasystephana, ranges from Colorado to California, and north to Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was collected in the valley of the Red Deer River, three days by trail from Lake Louise Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
