PYXIE
Pyxidanthera barbulata Michaux
The thrill of finding pyxie in the early spring is equaled only by the sensation of first discovering trailing-arbutus. This mosslike plant is Classed by botanists as an evergreen shrub, though in its creeping habit it does not seem a shrub at all. It is one of the few American representatives of the Diapensia Family, which is related to the heaths. The flowers are sessile and pure white, and nestle among the leaves, which are often dark red. It is sometimes grown in rock gardens, planted in a mixture of acid peat and clear sand, and thrives in either moist or dry situations.
Pyxie is found in dry, sandy pine barrens from North Carolina to southern New Jersey.
The specimen sketched came from Whitesbog, New Jersey.
