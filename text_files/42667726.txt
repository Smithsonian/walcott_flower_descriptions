BOG KALMIA
Kalmia polifolia Wangenheim
Bog kalmia is a handsome member of the Heath Family, though never so showy as Kalmia latifolia, the mountain-laurel of our hillsides and woods. Growing in sphagnum bogs, it is a shrub two feet of less in height, with thick, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the winter. The flowers are attractive to bees, but the leaves, like those of other Kalmias, are poisonous to stock. The fruit is a small, dry capsule. This species is easily distinguished from lambkill, Kalmia angustifolia, with which it is sometimes confused, by the insertion of the flowers at the naked tip of the stem, rather than among the leaves. Bog kalmia ranges from northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania to Michigan, and northward to Alaska, Hudson Bay, and Newfoundland.
The specimen sketched was cultivated in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, District of Columbia.
