HIGHBUSH BLACKBERRY
Rubus argutus Link
Highbush blackberry, when in bloom, is one of our most showy bushes. It is then a mass of tender white flowers with a background of dark green leaves. It adorns roadsides, fence corners, and waste places, wherever it can find an undisturbed space. A little later it is loaded with fine clusters of red and green fruit, black and luscious when ripe. The blackberries cultivated in America are improved forms of the wild species. They belong to the Rose Family.
This particular species of blackberry prefers a dry soil, and ranges, mostly at low altitudes, from Virginia northward to Massachusetts. Closely related species cover a much wider territory.
The specimen sketched grew at Washington, District of Columbia.
