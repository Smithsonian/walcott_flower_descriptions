FRINGED PARNASSIA
Parnassia fimbriata Konig
Fringed parnassia is a hardy and beautiful plant, closely related to the Saxifrage Family. The dainty flower stalks spring from a cluster of smooth green leaves, each stem supporting a single creamy white flower about an inch across, and the delicate fringes along the sides of the petals are a feature seldom found in flowers. The plants grow plentifully along rivulets, and on moist banks irrigated by snow-water. The size of the plant varies greatly with altitude. In low-lying valleys the flower stems may be two feet tall, but on higher mountain slopes only an inch or two in length.
Fringed parnassia is distributed from California and New Mexico northward to Alberta and Alaska.
The plant sketched grew near Lake O'Hara, ten miles from Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
