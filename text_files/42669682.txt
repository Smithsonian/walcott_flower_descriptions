CAROLINA JESSAMINE
Gelsemium sempervirens (Linnaeus) Persoon
Carolina jessamine, called “jasamer” by the natives of some parts of the South, is one of the delights of early spring in that region. It is a large vine whose woody, tangled, twining stems seek support upon the smaller trees, and then spread in riotous confusion over the tree tops. The clear yellow flowers are borne freely on the many leafy stems at the top, their delightful odor calling the bees to the feast of nectar spread for them. From the buds and seed pods an active medicinal preparation is made, but it must be used with care, as it is a narcotic poison.
Carolina jessamine is the State flower of South Carolina. It is found from Florida to Texas and northward to eastern Virginia, and grows also in Mexico. But one other species of the genus Gelsemium is known, which is a native of Asia.
The sketch was made from specimens gathered near Beaufort, South Carolina.
