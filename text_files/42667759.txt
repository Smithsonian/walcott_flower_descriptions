ROCK WILLOW
Salix petrophila Rydberg
This diminutive willow occurs on mountain slopes where other species of willow also flourish, but grows only four or five inches tall, and has the appearance rather of an herb than of a shrub. As soon as the overlying blanket of snow melts, the stems come to life. When the catkins are fully developed, the whole plant is very lovely, and attracts many small bees and other insects. The pollen falls in a golden shower when the branches are shaken. The pistillate flowers develop rapidly into silky heads during the long days of sunshine in June and July. The silk-tipped seeds, loosening from the split pods, are then blown by the wind to a new location.
Rock willow occurs on alpine peaks from New Mexico to California and north to British Columbia and Mackenzie.
The specimen sketched was found on the slopes of Mt. Wapta heat Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
