RHODORA
Rhodora canadensis Linnaeus
Rhodora is surrounded with romantic interest, because of the attention drawn to it by Emerson’s verses. It is the only plant of its genus. The rosy-purple flowers, usually appearing before the leaves, burst suddenly into bloom and form masses of color on wet hillsides or along the margins of acid swamps. Their shape suggests a relationship to the rhododendron, with which this plant is grouped by some botanists. Rhodora bushes grow from one to three feet high, and are inconspicuous except when in flower.
The range of rhodora is rather limited; presumably it survived the glacial period near the margins of the ice sheets, and it now occupies glaciated territory from northeastern Pennsylvania to Newfoundland.
The specimen sketched was collected at Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania.
THE RHODORA
In May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,
I found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,
Spreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,
To please the desert and the sluggish brook.
The purple petals, fallen in the pool,
Made the black water with their beauty gay;
Here might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,
And court the flower that cheapens his array.
Rhodora! if the sages ask thee why
This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,
Tell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,
Then Beauty is its own excuse for being:
Why thou were there, O rival of the rose!
I never thought to ask, I never knew;
But in my simple ignorance suppose
The self-same Power that brought me there brought you.
RALPH WALDO EMERSON.
