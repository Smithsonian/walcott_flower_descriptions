NORTHERN BEDSTRAW
Galium boreale Linnaeus
In many parts of North America northern bedstraw is a familiar plant. Although essentially northern in its distribution, as its name implies, it is not an Arctic plant, but seems to thrive best in regions of only moderately cold climate. In the central and southern Rockies it is abundant at middle and high altitudes, but farther north it frequents the foothills, extending out upon the plains. The plant sometimes forms dense clumps which afford a bouquet of feathery white flower sprays that are delicately scented. In the Rockies the name wild heliotrope is occasionally applied to the plant, although its fragrance is scarcely suggestive of our garden heliotrope.
Northern bedstraw grows in a great variety of situations, on open banks among rocks and grasses, in aspen thickets, or along streams, where the abundant moisture develops luxuriant plants that are sometimes two feet high. The species ranges from Pennsylvania, Missouri, and southern California, northward over the greater part of Canada and Alaska, and is widely distributed also in northern Europe and Asia.
This plant is one of a large group of the Madder Family, some members of which produce, in their roots, a red or purple dye. Most of our American bedstraws are unattractive plants, with weak rough stems and insignificant flowers.
The sketch was made from a specimen found near Banff, Alberta, Canada.
