RED LILY
Lilium montanum Nelson
Such hosts of red lilies are seen in the dry woods of the Canadian Rockies in some sections in July, that the prodigality of nature seems astounding. If perchance a richer soil and more sunlight are available, the perfectly developed flowers and the stouter leaves and stems indicate an appreciation of these favors. But the red lilies are tender things, withering speedily when gathered, especially when exposed to sun and wind, and they do not easily revive when placed in water.
The red lily is found in the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to British Columbia, and eastward in the foothills and valleys.
The specimen painted was gathered in Sinclair Canyon, not far from Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
