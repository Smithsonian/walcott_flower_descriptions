AMERICAN VETCH
Vicia americana Muhlenberg
American vetch is one of the most graceful and beautiful members of its group. It loves moist ground, and may be found in open meadows, in brushy thickets, or even in the forest. It is a weak vine, clinging for support to its neighbors by the forked tendrils which tip the leaves in a hold almost impossible to disentangle. The fruit is a small flat pod.
American vetch ranges widely, being found from Virginia west to Arizona and north to New Brunswick and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
