PURPLE PRAIRIECLOVER
Petalostemon purpureum (Ventenat) Rydberg
Purple prairieclover, as its name implies, grows abundantly in the prairie country. It is an attractive plant, and its blossoms have the advantage of lasting longer, when gathered and placed in water, than most of our wild flowers.
Purple prairieclover belongs to the Pea Family. It has a rather wide range, being found from Indiana to Colorado and Texas, and northward to Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
The sketch was made from specimens found on the prairie east of Glacier National Park in Montana.
