SHOWY LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium reginae Walter
The showy ladyslipper is considered by many to be the most beautiful of our native species of Cypripedium. It loves peat bogs or low wet woods; thus only those willing to meet the difficulties of tramping in such places are rewarded by finding the shy beauty. Its flowers are also the largest of the North American ladyslippers, and it may have one or more blossoms to crown its leafy stem. The State of Minnesota has chosen the showy ladyslipper as its State flower, and it was the first of the States to adopt such an emblem.
The plant has a rather wide distribution, occurring from Georgia to Minnesota and northward to Newfoundland and Ontario.
The plant sketched was obtained by Mr. Edwin Hale Lincoln near Lenox, Massachusetts.
