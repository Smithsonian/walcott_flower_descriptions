SPATTERDOCK
Nymphaea advena Solander
Spatterdocks, sometimes called yellow pondlilies, abound along the banks of sluggish streams and ponds. We usually think of them as coarse plants, though Longfellow, having in mind the northern spatterdock with its floating leaves, tells us that Hiawatha’s canoe
. . . floated on the river
Like a yellow leaf in autumn,
Like a yellow water-lily.
Indeed, with other plants that like to have their roots in the mud, they hide much that is unlovely on the borders of streams. The seeds of a Closely related species of the Pacific Coast furnished an important food for the Indians.
This species of spatterdock has a wide range, extending from Florida to Texas and northward to southern New York and Wisconsin. Closely related species occur almost throughout the United States, and in Canada, Alaska, and Europe.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
