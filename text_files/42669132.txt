ALASKA FLEABANE
Erigeron salsuginosus (Richardson) Gray
Of all the mountain flowers in the Canadian Rockies, Alaska fleabane is one of the most conspicuous on the higher slopes and in the alpine valleys. The flower heads are large, their bright yellow centers surrounded by purple rays. The stems are often eighteen inches tall. Growing in profusion, frequently with lemon columbine, they make the slopes gay with their colors. The horses apparently enjoy their flavor, and always try to nip them along the trail.
The range of this fleabane is from New Mexico to California, and northward to Alaska and Saskatchewan.
The sketch was made at Tilted Mountain Camp, eighteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
