HIGHBUSH BLUEBERRY
Vaccinium corymbosum Linnaeus
Highbush blueberry is better known by its delicious fruit than by the beautiful flowers which are so attractive in spring. These are borne thickly on the branches and attract many insects to their nectar feast. But it is when loaded with fruit that the plant’s principal claim to our interest is acknowledged. While the wild berry is attractive, the improved varieties developed by Dr. Frederick V. Coville are our admiration and delight. The berries of these cultivated forms have reached seven-eighths of an inch in diameter. Highbush blueberries are grown in acid soils, and as they are very hardy, many waste places in our Northern States can be utilized to produce a crop of delicious fruit.
Highbush blueberry ranges, in its numerous forms, from North Carolina (and perhaps farther southward) westward to the Mississippi Valley, and north to Minnesota and Maine.
The specimen sketched was grown in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington from specimens obtained in New Jersey.
