SKELETON FLOWER
Lygodesmia juncea (Pursh) Don
This is a strange-looking plant, a foot tall, with pale pink, starlike flowers that close in the afternoon, or very soon after being gathered. Unconsciously, the observer is likely to notice only the flowers, for the rushlike stems and scalelike foliage are sage-green and inconspicuous. The plant belongs to the subdivision of the Aster Family that includes the dandelion, wild lettuce, and hawkweed, and is characterized by having all the flowers of the head furnished with petallike rays, and by a bitter milky juice.
The skeletonflower is found from Nevada and New Mexico north to Minnesota and Alberta.
We found it growing on a dry bank, high above the Kootenai River, near the junction of this stream with the Columbia River in British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,800 feet, and marveled that it could thrive in dusty soil, which remains damp only a short time after the mountain showers cease.
