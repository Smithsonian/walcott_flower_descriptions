TURKSCAP LILY
Lilium superbum Linnaeus
It is not surprising that Linnaeus gave the specific name superbum to this beautiful lily. Anyone who has seen it growing in meadows or bogs in midsummer will never forget the impression created by a great number of these plants blooming together. The stems, which at times attain a height of seven feet, are crowned with a panicle of magnificent flowers, sometimes numbering forty, whose color varies from red to orange. This lovely wildling yields easily to garden treatment, especially in acid, boggy soil, and survives from year to year, even increasing in beauty.
Turkscap lily is found from the mountains of Georgia to Missouri, and northward to New Brunswick and Minnesota.
The flowers sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
