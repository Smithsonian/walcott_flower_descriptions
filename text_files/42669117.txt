MOURNING GROUNDSEL
Senecio lugens Richardson
Mourning groundsel is a peculiar plant, thriving in situations where camps have been located, and blooming late in the flowering season. The flower stalk, about a foot tall, rises from the center of a rosette of large leaves, and from the top of the stem a half dozen flowers on long stems sprawl irregularly. The name commemorates a massacre at Bloody Falls on the Coppermine River in Yukon, within the Arctic Circle, where a party of Eskimos was destroyed by Northern Indians who accompanied the explorer Herne.
The range of mourning groundsel is from Montana and Washington northward to Yukon.
Our sketch was made from a specimen found on the upper Pipestone River, fifteen miles northwest of Lake Louise, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
