ROSEBUD ORCHID
Pogonia divaricata (Linnaeus) Robert Brown
Rosebud orchid is widespread and abundant in the far South, and the acid-soil meadows of northern Florida are sometimes colored pink by thousands of its blossoms. Farther north it becomes rarer, and is seldom found even by the botanist, whose excursions lead him to remote fields and bogs. The lovely shading and delicate penciling of the petals lend a peculiar charm to this orchid. To people not familiar with the book name, it is often known as the “rosebud flower,” because of the resemblance of the lip to a slender rosebud. Some botanists hold that it is not a true Pogonia, assigning to it the name Cleistes divaricata.
Rosebud orchid is found from Florida and Alabama northward to Kentucky and southern New Jersey, growing both in lowlands near the coast and on high mountains.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Beaufort, South Carolina.
