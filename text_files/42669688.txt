YAUPON
Ilex vomitoria Aiton
Yaupon is a shrub or small tree, sometimes as much as twentyfive feet tall. It is especially handsome in autumn when covered with its beautiful red berries, which resemble those of its close relative, the American holly. It is worthy of wider cultivation as an ornamental plant in the Southern States. The fruits, when ripe, often do not remain long on the branches, for birds, especially mocking birds, are very fond of the berries, and soon strip the trees of them. Various early explorers tell us of the black drink, or cassena, used by the Indians of the South Atlantic States, which was brewed from yaupon leaves. The dried leaves, which contain about one-half of one per cent of caffeine, were steeped in water, which was then cooled by pouring rapidly from one vessel to another, this treatment producing frothiness. When very strong from long boiling, the liquid is black and bitter, and acts as an emetic, a quality which the Indians regarded lightly, and merely drank again. When, however, the leaves are heated with water for but a short time, a delicious drink is produced, and the United States Department of Agriculture is endeavoring to popularize this. It closely resembles maté or Paraguay tea, which is made from a related plant, and it promises to come into wider use as a substitute for tea, being more suitable than the latter for production under the labor conditions of this country.
Yaupon ranges along the Coastal Plain from Texas to Arkansas and Florida, and northward to Virginia.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Beaufort, South Carolina.
