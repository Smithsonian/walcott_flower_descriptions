TULIPTREE
Liriodendron tulipifera Linnaeus
This beautiful tree is a joy to behold at any season of the year. Its bare gray branches outlined against the winter sky impress one with their vigor of growth and sturdy health, and when the warmer days and Aprilshowers swell the buds, and the tiny young leaves appear, the tree bursts into its supreme glory. If in a sunny situation, it is soon covered with green tulip-shaped flowers, each cup beautifully decorated with a brilliant orange bar, to entice the visiting bees. In autumn the leaves are a mass of orange and gold.
The tuliptree is the only member of the genus Liriodendron in America, though a closely related species flourishes in central China, these two being the sole survivals of the Cretaceous Period, when members of the genus were widely distributed in America and Europe. Though it reaches its greatest size in the lower Ohio Basin, sometimes growing almost 200 feet high, it is found in the eastern United States from Louisiana to Florida and northward to Michigan and southern Vermont.
The wood has a variety of commercial uses, while the bark, especially that of the roots, yields a tonic and heart stimulant. The blossom of the tuliptree is the State flower of Indiana.
The specimen sketched was obtained at Washington, District of Columbia.
