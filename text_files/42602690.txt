BEARBERRY HONEYSUCKLE
Lonicera involucrata (Richardson) Banks
Beatberry honeysuckle is a plant that is conspicuous in July when the fruit ripens. The coarse, hairy leaves are of a dark rich green, and the twin berries, glossy black in color, are surrounded by a red frill, a combination which makes the bush very decorative. The unpretentious sttaw-colored flowers may sometimes be found on the younger branches along with the fruit produced by those that come into bloom earlier. If the bush is shaken, the ripe fruit falls easily. Its disagreeable flavor has gained for it the name of skunkberry in some regions.
Bearberry honeysuckle may be found from Quebec to Michigan, New Mexico, and California, and northward to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was collected near Hector, British Columbia, at an elevation af 4,000 feet.
