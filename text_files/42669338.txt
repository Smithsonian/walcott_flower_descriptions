MOSS CAMPION
Silene acaulis Linnaeus
Moss campion is one of the most attractive of the alpine plants and one frequently seen by the mountaineer climbing above timberline. Although its blooming season is short, differences in altitude and exposure in its many habitats are responsible for its blooming during a longer period than most alpine plants. It grows from a single woody root anchored deep in rocky soil, and spreads into a flat cushion often a foot or more in diameter. The bright green of the narrow leaves is beautifully contrasted with the pink, or rarely white, flowers, and the plant is always a joy to behold.
This lovely member of the Pink Family is found in arctic or arcticalpine situations, from New Hampshire to Greenland, across Canada and from the highest mountains of New Mexico to Alaska; also in Europe and Asia.
The plant sketched was procured near Baker Lake, fifteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
