WESTERN HEMLOCK
Tsuga heterophylla (Rafinesque) Sargent
Western hemlock is a tall tree with graceful feathery branches, quite different from the mountain hemlock in habit and in fruitage. It sometimes grows two hundred feet high, with a trunk six to nine feet in diameter. The small brown cones, not more than an inch long, are produced abundantly, and contrast with the background of shiny, dark green leaves. The leaves are marked on the lower surface with white bands.
This species of hemlock occurs from western Montana to northern California, Alberta, and Alaska.
The specimen was obtained at Glacier House, near Glacier, British Columbia, at an elevation of 3,500 feet.
