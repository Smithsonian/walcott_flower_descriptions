MOUNTAIN LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium montanum Douglas
One lovely morning in early summer we left camp near Radium Hot Springs in the Columbia River Valley in British Columbia, our two saddle horses harnessed to the buckboard, the saddles securely tied behind the seat. After a drive of seven miles the horses were saddled, and we followed a disused trail four or five miles back into the range on the eastern side of the valley. There were many flowers, the dense growth of trees and shrubs keeping out the hot rays of the sun and conserving the moisture. Just as we turned across a partially shaded flat on the side of the little canyon we had been traversing, a wonderful sight burst upon us. Scattered among the low-growing bushes were great clumps of this splendid orchid in the perfection of bloom. A beautiful plant about eighteen inches tall, with a delicate perfume quite its own-no wonder that we quickly dismounted to pay homage to this queen of the forest.
Never before had we seen such a flower, and no book upon the plants of the Canadian Rockies mentioned its occurrence there. A bunch carried to camp survived many days, long after the sketch was completed.
The mountain ladyslipper is frequently found in the mountains of California, and northward along the coast as far as Vancouver, and northeastward along the Rocky Mountains to Saskatchewan.
