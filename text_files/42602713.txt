GREENDRAGON
Arisaema dracontium (Linnaeus) Schott
Greendragon is a vigorous plant and decidedly decorative, though its flower lacks the handsomer coloring of the jack-in-the-pulpit, its near relative. It is, however, of similar habit. Its deeply parted leaves growing on a long stem from the solid globular bulb or corm, reach a height of two feet or more. It loves the same rich, moist woods or low ground frequented by the jack-in-the-pulpit, but is rarely so abundant. The berrylike fruits of the greendragon are red-orange in color, and are clustered in heads that become conspicuous in early autumn. They are much more effective in calling attention to the plant than its green flowers or its foliage.
The range of the greendragon is rather wide, extending from Texas to Florida and northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and Maine.
This specimen grew along the Potomac River above Washington, District of Columbia.
