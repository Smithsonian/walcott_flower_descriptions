FIRE PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon eatontii Gray
The thrifty clumps of fire pentstemon growing in perfection among the rocks or pendent from the sides of a canyon wall are strikingly handsome. They seem to delight in the most inaccessible places, and thrive in the scantiest pocket of soil, their flexible stems, two to three feet long, waving in the wind. This plant is one of the showiest members of the Figwort Family.
Fire pentstemon has a comparatively narrow range in Arizona, Utah, and Nevada.
The specimens grew near Superior, Arizona.
