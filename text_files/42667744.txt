WESTERN YARROW
Achillea lanulosa Nuttall
Western yarrow is such a common plant that we usually pass it by without appreciation of its beauty. Growing everywhere, and especially in neglected places, its white heads and feathery foliage are known to everyone. The crushed leaves and flowers have a pungent and somewhat irritant odor, which sometimes causes sneezing. Forms in which the heads have pink instead of white rays are not uncommon in the Rocky Mountains. A closely related species of very similar appearance is a weed in fields and waste places in the eastern United States. The genus name of these plants was given in commemoration of Achilles.
Western yarrow ranges from Oklahoma to Mexico and California, and northward to Quebec, Ontario, Michigan, and Yukon.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Red Deer River, twenty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,700 feet.
