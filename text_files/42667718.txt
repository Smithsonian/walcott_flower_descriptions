HEPATICA
Hepatica americana Ker
“There are many things left for May,” writes John Burroughs,“but nothing fairer, if as fair, as the first flower, the hepatica. I find I have never admired this little firstling half enough. When at the maturity of its charms it is certainly the gem of the woods.” With the first warm days of spring the soft woolly buds spring from the heart of the plant, where they were formed in the autumn. The hardy blooms make their first appearance on southern slopes in the woods. Often they are half hidden by the leaves, which persist from the previous season. The flowers vary in color from pale blue to white and pink, and often have an alluring odor, though this characteristic varies in different plants. The new leaves develop as soon as the flowers fall.
Blue as the heaven it gazes at,
Startling the loiterer in the naked groves
With unexpected beauty: for the time
Of blossoms and green grass is yet afar.
GIBSON
