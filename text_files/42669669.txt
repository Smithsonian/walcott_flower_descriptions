PARTRIDGEBERRY
Mitchella repens Linnaeus
Partridgeberry grows in either dry or moist, partially shaded situations, forming deep green mats which creep closely over the ground. The leaves continue green throughout the winter. The sweet-scented flowers are often hidden beneath dry leaves strewn over the soil. They remind us of the blossoms of trailing-arbutus, though they always grow in pairs and not in clusters, like the flowers of that plant. The twin fruits frequently remain on the plant until spring, as in the specimen sketched. Grouse and quail are very fond of the bright red berries, which to our taste are insipid. This plant belongs to the Madder Family. It is easily cultivated in acid soil. The genus Mitchella was named in honor of Dr. John Mitchell, one of the earliest botanists of eastern Virginia, and a correspondent of Linnaeus.
Partridgeberry is found from Florida to Texas, and northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Minnesota. It occurs also in the mountains of southern Mexico.
Our specimen was collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.
