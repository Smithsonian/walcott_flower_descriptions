WHITE DRYAD
Dryas octopetala Linnaeus
White dryad is a very decorative plant in its chosen habitat. It flourishes best in a soil of disintegrated limestone, and it is also found clinging to rough limestone rocks, where it forms close mats, its green foliage hiding the interlaced masses of woody stems and dead leaves beneath. Above these mats the beautiful cup-shaped flowers with their golden centers are borne on dainty stems from one to four inches tall. The flowers attract many bees and small flies. The stems and leaves are sticky, and have a resinous odor.
White dryad belongs to the Rose Family, and is found from Labrador and Greenland throughout Arctic America, and in the Rocky Mountains from Utah and Colorado to British Columbia. It occurs also in northern Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made from plants that grew in Skoki Valley, fifteen miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
