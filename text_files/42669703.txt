SNOW TRILLIUM
Trillium grandiflorum (Michaux) Salisbury
Snow trilliums area delight to behold when they reach the perfection of growth in spring along with other early spring flowers. They love woodland regions, pushing up from the ground through the covering of brown leaves, and waving in every fitful breeze that blows. As the flowers fade they are flushed with a dainty pink color. Snow trilliums are easily grown and quickly spread through the woods when planted, needing no especial care. The soil must be rich, moist, and well drained. The trilliums belong to the Lily Family.
The snow trillium has a rather wide range, extending from North Carolina to Missouri and northward to Minnesota, Ontario and Quebec.
The sketch was made from plants grown near Washington, District of Columbia.
