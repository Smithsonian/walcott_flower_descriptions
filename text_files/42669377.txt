SALTMARSH ROSEGENTIAN
Sabbatia stellaris Pursh
The delicate star-shaped flowers of marsh rosegentian are distributed plentifully in salt marshes along the Atlantic coast, and acres of the flowers may be seen in favored places in midsummer. The color varies from white to deep pink. The contrast between the color of the petals and the carmine-bordered yellow eye is most pleasing. Many other Sabbatias grow in the eastern half of the United States, especially southward. Some of them have even larger and brighter flowers than the saltmarsh rosegentian. The Sabbatias belong to the Gentian Family.
Because of its preference for salt, this plant does not extend inland, but it spreads along the coast from Florida to Louisiana and Maine. The flowers sketched were found near Bridgeport, Connecticut.
