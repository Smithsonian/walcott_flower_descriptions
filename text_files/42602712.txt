TOAD TRILLIUM
Trillium sessile Linnaeus
Unlike most other members of its group, this trillium has a rather pleasant odor, but it does not approach other species in attractiveness, for its curious sessile flowers are dull in color. Normally the petals are of a deep maroon color, but in some plants, which show no differences, they are pale greenish yellow. It prefers deep, moist woods, and is easily overlooked among the fresh growths of April or May.
Toad trillium is a typical member of the flora of the Middle Western States, ranging from Mississippi to Florida, northward to Minnesota and western New York; occasionally it crosses the Appalachian Mountains and pushes down river valleys as far north as Maryland and southernmost Pennsylvania.
The specimen sketched grew on Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.
