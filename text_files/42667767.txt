MISTMAIDEN
Romanzoffia sitchensis Bongard
Mistmaiden is a dainty alpine plant that is found at or above tree line almost anywhere in the northern Rockies, if growth conditions are favorable. It grows frequently in rock crevices, and delights in moist spots where water from melting snow seeps through the earth or drips from the rocks above. During the short growing season it is able to endure the freezing temperatures that are frequent at night. It is but rarely that the delicate stems and fragile flowers are injured or destroyed. The first specimen that we found was carried to camp and placed in water in a tin outside the tent. In the morning, to our dismay the water was a solid block of ice, and we thought the beautiful specimen was ruined ; but when the ice melted the plant was as fresh as ever.
This interesting member of the Waterleaf Family ranges from Montana to northern California and Alaska. As its specific name, sitchensis, indicates, the plant was collected first at Sitka, Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew near Lake O'Hara in the Canadian Rockies, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,600 feet.
