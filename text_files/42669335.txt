YELLOW DRYAD
Dryas drummondii Richardson
As yellow dryad is usually seen by mountain visitors, its mats of crinkled leaves are surmounted by fluffy seed heads, for the flowers open early and last for only a brief season. The plant grows most profusely in gravelly glacial stream bottoms, in limestone soil. Here it abounds until overwhelmed in midsummer by the high waters of melting glacial ice, surviving only on portions of the stream banks left undisturbed by the rushing water. The pale yellow flower always turns its face downward, and does not open fully to the sunlight. The dryads belong to the Rose Family.
This species is found often at high elevations, from Quebec to Montana, British Columbia, and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was procured in the Ice River Valley, twenty-five miles by trail from Leanchoil Station on the Canadian Pacific Railroad, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
