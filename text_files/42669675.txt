RED PINESAP
Hypopitys lanuginosa (Michaux) Nuttall
Because of its bright red color, red pinesap is more showy than some of its near relatives. Like them it is a plant of fungus-like appearance, because of the complete lack of the green coloring which characterizes nearly all flowering plants. It grows in woodlands, springing from decayed vegetable mould. The plants develop and flower usually in rather late summer, but in the southern part of their range as early as June.
The red pinesap is widely distributed, being found from Florida to Louisiana, and north to Quebec and Newfoundland. It is sometimes referred to the same genus (Monotropa) as the Indianpipe.
The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
