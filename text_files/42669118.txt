SLENDER SHOOTINGSTAR
Dodecatheon pauciflorum (Durand) Greene
Slender shootingstar has a delicate habit of growth, and appears so frail that one wonders how it thrives in its chosen location. It loves moist places, such as wet meadows, or rocky ledges where cold water trickles down. The stems rise from the center of a loose tuft of green leaves. The flowers always remind us of the cyclamen, and this is not surprising, as both belong to the Primrose Family.
The range of slender shootingstar is rather wide, from Colorado northward to Saskatchewan, Mackenzie, British Columbia, and Alaska.
The sketch was made from a specimen found in the valley above Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
