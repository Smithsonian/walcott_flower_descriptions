CARDINALFLOWER
Lobelia cardinalis Linnaeus
Cardinalflower, one of the most brilliantly colored of all our wild flowers, loves swampy places or the banks of streams, where in midsummer it teaches its perfection. The long spikes continue to bloom for weeks. The flowers open in succession from the lowest buds on the stem to those at the top. For this reason, the plant is easily exterminated in its native haunts, the flowers at the top of the stems being gathered with the old flowers and ripening seeds below. The color of the flowers is likened to that of a cardinal’s hat, and surely the corolla of no other of our wild flowers is so rich and velvety. Cardinalflower may be grown easily from seed, but in gardens it must be treated as a biennial unless its wet habitat can be reproduced. In the wild state, it is perennial by offsets.
Cardinalflower occurs from Florida westward to Texas, Kansas, and Colorado, and north to New Brunswick and Ontario.
The sketch was obtained from specimens gathered near Pocono Manor, Pennsylvania.
