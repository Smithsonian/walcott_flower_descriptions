LADDER GENTIAN
Gentiana acuta Michaux
Ladder gentian is not so handsome or showy as many other gentians. The stems are stiff and frequently dark red in color. The numerous flowers are lavender or sometimes white, and spring from the stem in the axils of the upper leaves. Often the plants are almost pyramidal in form, especially when growing among other plants in full sunshine in upland meadows. This species prefers rather dry, sandy soil, and as the roots are very shallow, the plants are easily pulled up.
Ladder gentian ranges from New Mexico to California and north to Alaska, and from Maine to Labrador. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made from a specimen secured near Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
