MOSS GENTIAN
Gentiana prostrata Haenke
This tiny gentian will escape all but the keenest eyes. The flowers open only in bright sunshine, and the stems creep through the grass, as though to elude detection. The corollas are usually of the brightest blue, but sometimes they are white. The minute green leaves have a narrow white cartilaginous border which is not found in other gentians. This is a truly alpine plant. It is the smallest of the North American gentians.
The moss gentian ranges from the Colorado Rockies to Alberta and Alaska and the Arctic regions of the Old World. The American plant differs slightly from the typical Eurasian form and is sometimes recognized as variety americana.
This specimen was found near the shore of Lake Magog at the base of Mount Assiniboine, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
