AMERICAN MISTLETOE
Phoradendron flavescens (Pursh) Nuttall
The mistletoe of romance does not grow in America, but our native species serve the same decorative purpose, and are used at Christmas time with holly and other evergreens. There are several kinds of mistletoe, parasitic on both evergreen and deciduous trees. The name Phoradendron, applied to the principal American genus of the Mistletoe Family, is derived from Greek words meaning “treethief.” Where American mistletoe is plentiful it often kills its host. The flowers appear in September, but the fruit does not mature until the following year. Each berry contains a single seed.
This species of mistletoe is found from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to New Jersey and Ohio.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained in Virginia, where it grows chiefly on tupelo trees, but sometimes on red maples.
