CRANBERRYBUSH
Viburnum pauciflorum Pylaic
Cranberrybush is a straggling erect shrub growing in cold mountain woods and along the banks of streams. The few red berries are very attractive, but are sour to the taste, not unlike ordinary cranberries. The cranberrybush belongs to the Honeysuckle Family, while the true cranberry, a small slender trailing plant, belongs to the Heath Family.
The cranberrybush ranges from Pennsylvania to Newfoundland and from Colorado to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River Valley, in British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,500 feet.
