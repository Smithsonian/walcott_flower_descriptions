LIMBER PINE
Pinus flexilis James
Limber pine appears to enjoy growing in difficult positions and is often seen springing from clefts in the rocks on the mountain sides, where it would seem impossible for a tree to obtain a foothold. The branches are exceedingly flexible, bending readily under the heavy weight of the developing cones, and seeming scarcely able to withstand the strain.
Limber pine is found in the Rocky Mountain region from northern Mexico to Alberta, and in some of the higher desert ranges westward to southern California.
The specimen sketched was obtained from Devils Gap, east of Lake Minnewonka, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
