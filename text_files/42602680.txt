WILD SWEET CRAB
Malus coronaria (Linnaeus) Miller
What sweeter blossoms are to be found in spring than those of the wild sweet crab? It is usually a low bushy tree, growing perhaps twenty feet high, with tangled branches making a flat top, quite inconspicuous in its wild surroundings. But when early spring is past, and the bushes are masses of tender green, the pink buds appear, and soon the whole ts covered with lovely flowers, whose sweet scent is wafted far on every breeze. The fruit, also, is sweet-scented, and can be made into elegant delicious jelly.
The wild sweet crab is a native of the Central States, extending from Louisiana and Alabama northward to Michigan and Ontario, but in cultivation over a much wider range.
This specimen was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
