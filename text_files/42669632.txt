GROUSE WHORTLEBERRY
Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg
Grouse whortleberries mature rapidly, and by the middle of August the plants are well fruited with pleasantly flavored bright red berries. These are much enjoyed by grouse, which are usually found where the berries are plentiful.
Grouse whortleberry occurs in the higher mountains from New Mexico to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was collected in the valley of the Red Deer River twenty miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
