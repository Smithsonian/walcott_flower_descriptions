OCOTILLO
Fouquieria splendens Engelmann
In crossing the desert by train over the southern route to California, none of the new and curious plants observed is stranger than the ocotillo. A number of slender rod-like stems eight or ten feet long spring from a single root, rigidly spreading outward and upward. They are dull greenish gray in color, and are armed with strong sharp thorns half an inch long. When the rains come in spring, the bare stems show signs of life, small green leaves appearing along them, while a mass of buds develops on a short stem at the end, spreading like a fish tail. Soon the buds open and the heavy bunches of flowers wave slowly back and forth in the desert wind. The Mexicans form paling fences about their dooryards by planting these stems close together in the ground and fastening them with wire. They sometimes take root and form a living fence, an effective barrier against most animals. This curious plant belongs to a small group known as the Ocotillo Family, which is nearly confined to the dry regions of Mexico.
Ocotillo has a wide range, from western Texas to southern California and over northern Mexico.
The specimen painted was obtained near Superior, Arizona.
