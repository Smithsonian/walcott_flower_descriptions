WHITEFLOWERING RASPBERRY
Rubus parviflorus Nuttall
The slightly crinkled petals of the whiteflowering raspberry are conspicuous against their background of rich green maple-shaped leaves. It is fully as attractive as its eastern relative, the flowering raspberry, which bears purple flowers. The whiteflowering raspberry grows from two to six feet tall, the lower part of the stems being brown and woody. It frequents rich woods often at high altitudes in the mountains. The berries are disappointing to the taste, and full of small seeds. The plant belongs to the Rose Family, its range extending from extreme northern Mexico to California and Alaska, and eastward to Michigan and westernmost Ontario.
In the vicinity of Glacier, British Columbia, where the sketch was made, and all through the Selkirk Mountains, it is especially abundant. This specimen was obtained at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
