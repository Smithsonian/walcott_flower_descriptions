CROSSVINE
Anisostichus capreolatus (Linnaeus) Bureau
Although its flowers are very showy, crossvine is not familiar to many flower lovers. Its glossy, evergreen, paired leaves are borne on tough, tangled, woody stems with stout tendrils. The plant is nearly related to the trumpet-creeper, but is easily distinguished from it by the shorter trumpet of its flower. In some botanical works it is listed as Bignonia crucigera, the species name meaning crossbearer. In a section of the stem certain elements of the wood make a perfect cross, hence the name crossvine. In autumn the leaves turn to a bronze color. The crossvine prefers moist, almost swampy situations having an acid soil.
The plant ranges from Florida to Louisiana, and northward to Virginia, southern Ohio, and Illinois.
The specimen sketched was gathered near Beaufort, South Carolina.
