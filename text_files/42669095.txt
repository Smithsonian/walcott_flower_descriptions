PINKSHELL AZALEA
Azalea vaseyi (Gray) Rehder
The pinkshell azalea is so charming in form and color that it deserves attention from flower lovers who cultivate our native plants. It prefers rather moist, acid soil, and yields easily to cultivation. The corolla is so different in shape from that of other Azaleas that it is considered by some botanists to belong to a distinct genus, named Biltia in honor of George Vanderbilt.
Pinkshell azalea has a narrow range, being found only at a few restricted localities in the mountains of western North Carolina. For many years nurserymen have been digging and shipping this species from its native haunts, until it has been nearly exterminated as a wild plant. Fortunately it can be propagated in acid soils from seed.
The specimen sketched was grown by Dr. Paul Bartsch in his garden in Washington, District of Columbia.
