MEXICAN FREMONTIA
Fremontodendron mexicanum Davidson
Fremontia is quite unlike any other plant of the Pacific coast. It grows as a shrub or small tree with many branches. When the showy flowers first open they are bright yellow, but they soon fade to red and finally turn brown. The flowers remain on their stalks after they have withered, and a bizarre effect is produced by the various colors of flowers in different stages of development.
The genus Fremontodendron was named for General John C. Frémont, one of the early explorers of the West. The Mexican fremontia has a narrow range, and is found only in southern California and northern Lower California. The only other species, Fremontodendron californicum, grows farther northward in the mountains of California.
The specimen sketched was grown in Los Angeles, California.
