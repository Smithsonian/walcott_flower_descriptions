SPIDERLILY
Hymenocallis rotata (Ker) Herbert
This species of spiderlily is an inhabitant of sandy beaches, growing just beyond the reach of the surf. In such locations it usually forms dense clumps of fifty or more bulbs. The broad, green sword-like leaves of this and related species form a conspicuous element of some Florida and West Indian beaches. The spiderlily, a member of the Amaryllis Family, grows from a large bulb.
This species ranges from Florida to the coastal plain of North Carolina.
The specimen here drawn came from Loggerhead Key, Dry Tortugas, Florida.
