WOOD SKULLCAP
Scutellaria serrata Andrews
This species is one of the most showy and beautiful of all the skullcaps, of which there are over sixty species in the United States. Its large, blue-purple flowers and the bright-green scentless foliage distinguish it from most other members of the Mint Family native in the Eastern States. It is a forest plant, apparently preferring soils of low acidity, forming small dense clumps, and flowering in May and June. Pink and white forms are occasionally found.
Wood skullcap ranges from South Carolina to Alabama and northward to New York and Illinois.
The sketch was made from a specimen found near Washington, District of Columbia.
