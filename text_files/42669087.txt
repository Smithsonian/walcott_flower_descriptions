BLUE PHLOX
Phlox divaricata Linnaeus
Blue phlox is a lovely flower of spring. It often grows in company with cream-white violets in rich valleys, beneath tall trees, affording a delightful combination of dainty color. In its wild state, this species of phlox is variable, the color ranging from pinkish to pale violet, and the corolla-lobes may be entire or deeply notched. It was one of the earliest American plants to be cultivated in Europe, being illustrated in Miller's “Figures of Plants” in 1758.
At Plummers Island, near Washington, District of Columbia, where the specimens sketched were obtained, visitors are not permitted to gather the flowers, and in consequence blue phlox has thrived and grows in great profusion, filling the woods with its fragrance. The plant is well adapted to cultivation in shady gardens.
Blue phlox is found from Florida to eastern Texas and northward to Quebec and Minnesota.
