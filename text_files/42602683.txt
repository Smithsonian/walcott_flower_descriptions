WINTERBERRY
Ilex verticillata (Linnaeus) Gray
In spring, when all nature is awakening, we easily overlook this inconspicuous shrub, from four to six feet tall, with tender leaves and tiny flowers, growing in damp acid ground among the other denizens of neglected places. But when autumn passes and the stems are stripped of their leaves, the fine red berries come into their own, and lend a delightful touch of color to the winter landscape. The whole top of the bush is covered with berries, and it then vies with its cousin, the holly, in beauty and interest, and in radiating Christmas cheer and good will. The berries stay on the branches till late winter, and are rarely eaten by birds. A form with yellow fruit has been found in New England.
Another member of the genus Ilex is the well-known shrub, maté, whose leaves are largely used in South America for making a beverage similar to Chinese tea. From yaupon, an Ilex of our Southern States, the Indians make a stimulating drink, and it is now being placed on the market, under the name Cassina, as a substitute for tea.
Winterberry ranges from Missouri to Florida, and northward to Wisconsin and Nova Scotia.
The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
