RAYLESS GROUNDSEL
Senecio pauciflorus Pursh
Rayless groundsel, though not usually conspicuous, gives in midsummer a touch of brilliant color amid the otherwise dull grasses and willows of the mountain meadows. At first sight it seems to be a budding flower, soon to unfold, but the long rays characteristic of most other species of composites are absent, and the head expands no further.
Rayless groundsel extends from Michigan to Wyoming and California, and northward to Labrador, Quebec, and Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew in the valley of Johnson Creek, twelve miles northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
