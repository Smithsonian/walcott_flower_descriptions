BROOK LOBELIA
Lobelia kalmii Linnaeus
Brook lobelia is abundant locally in the Canadian Rockies. The sturdiest specimens seen were growing beside a brook that found its way through a bed of disintegrated calcareous tufa. It is a dainty and pretty plant, though not to be compared in showiness with its relatives, the cardinalflower and the large blue lobelia.
The range of brook lobelia is wide—in moist calcareous soils from New Jersey northward to Newfoundland and westward to Iowa and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Canal Flats, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
