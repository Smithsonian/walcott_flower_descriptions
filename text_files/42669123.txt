GOLDEN SEDGE
Carex aurea Nuttall
Sharp eyes are needed to find this attractive sedge in fruit, for it grows near the ground among other grasses and plants. Its seeds are heavy in proportion to the slender stems, and the bunches are borne over toward the ground. We have frequently found it on the flats of glacier-fed streams, where the hot mid-day sun melted the ice and sent down a flood of water every afternoon.
Golden sedge has a wide range, being found from Pennsylvania and Connecticut to Newfoundland, and westward to New Mexico and California and northward to Yukon.
The specimen sketched was obtained at Lone Pine Camp, in the valley of the Siffleur River in Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
