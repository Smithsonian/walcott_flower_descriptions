PEARL EVERLASTING
Anaphalis margaritacea (Linnaeus) Gray
Pearl everlasting, with its clusters of yellow-centered white flower heads, grows plentifully in many situations, but it is not one of the most beautiful of the mountain flowers. The white, cottony leaves and stems contrast with the background of dark green grasses and leafy plants among which the plants grow. The flowers are sometimes dried for winter use in making wreaths and other decorations, and they are often dyed red for use at Christmas. The plant belongs to the Aster Family.
Pearl everlasting has a wide range, being found from Pennsylvania to Kansas and California, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska. It occurs also in Asia.
The specimen sketched was gathered near Moose Creek, in the valley of the Kootenay River, forty miles southwest of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
