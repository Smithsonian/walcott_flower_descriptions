LEATHERFLOWER
Clematis viorna Linnaeus
The leatherflower is not so showy as the other members of the clematis group, nevertheless its graceful stems and leaves and reddish purple blossoms are not uninteresting. The sepals are remarkable in being a sixteenth of an inch thick, as if made of leather instead of the delicate tissue usual in flowers in which petals are lacking and the sepals are required to take their place. The feathery fruit, more attractive than the flowers, is erect and silky, each individual “seed” possessing a tail almost two inches long, by means of which it may be carried by the wind, when ripe, to a favorable situation.
This scrambling vine may be found in thickets where the soil is rocky but rather rich, from Alabama and Georgia northward to Ohio and Pennsylvania.
The sketch was made from a specimen gathered near Washington, District of Columbia.
