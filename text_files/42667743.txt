CURLY CLEMATIS
Clematis crispa Linnaeus
The graceful flowers of curly clematis are almost of the texture of crêpe, and the leaves add to the dainty beauty of the vine. This clematis is a close relative of the leatherflower, and like that is sometimes referred to a separate genus, Viorna. Its fruit is a mass of hard seedlike achenes, each tipped with a long feathery tail. It is a member of the Buttercup Family.
Curly clematis is distributed from Florida to Texas, and northward to Virginia and Missouri.
The specimen sketched grew near Yemassee, South Carolina.
