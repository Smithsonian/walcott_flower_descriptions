ROSE POGONIA
Pogonia ophioglossoides (Linnaeus) Ker
Rose pogonia blooms at about the same time as the grass-pink orchid. It chooses the same swamps and wet meadows for its habitat, and the two are often found growing together. Its beautiful fringed lip is an enticing landing place for the bees, which are attracted also by the fresh raspberry odor of the flowers. Its roots are fibrous, and it propagates by runners as well as by seeds.
The plant has a wide range, extending from Florida to Texas and northward to Illinois, Minnesota, Ontario, and Newfoundland. It is found also in Japan.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Tuckerton, New Jetsey.
