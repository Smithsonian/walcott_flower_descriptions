LYALL LARCH
Larix lyallii Parlatore
Of all the trees in the Canadian Rockies, Lyall larch is the most interesting and the most picturesque. It is usually found between 6,000 and 8,000 feet elevation, where its bright green foliage is easily recognized from a distance, skirting the darker green spruces and fits at timberline. A rugged tree, gnarled and twisted by the wind into picturesque forms, it reaches a height of fifty feet in favorable localities, with a trunk diameter of twenty inches. The cones are produced about once in three years. The wood is tough and hard to cut, but it makes a very hot although not lasting fire. As soon as a hard frost comes, the leaves turn bright yellow and soon fall. Doctor Charles S. Sargent and William M. Canby journeyed all the way from Boston in 1898 to find this tree in fruit. I had been stopping at Lake Louise and had procured a number of branches of Lyall larch with beautiful cones, from the shores of Lake Agnes. On arriving at Banff, I left my precious specimens on the rack beside the dining room door, while I got my supper. When the meal was finished, the bunch of larch had disappeared. On investigation I found the two botanists sitting on the floor, with the Lyall larch between them, filled with enthusiasm that their long journey would be a fruitful one.
Lyall larch has a very narrow range. It grows in a few places in Montana and in northern Oregon, but is plentiful only in Alberta and British Columbia.
The branch sketched came from near Lake McArthur, twelve miles by trail from Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
