MISSOURI PRICKLYPEAR
Opuntia polyacantha Haworth
The Missouri pricklypear is one of the commonest of the cactuses. The flowers are so beautiful that one forgets the wicked spines and the still more dangerous spicules, which are found on the thick stems of flat joints, until one endeavors to gather them. In the bright sunshine of early morning the dry prairies in some sections are dotted with masses of pale sulphut-yellow flowers, turning salmon in the late afternoon as they fade. The sensitive stamens are sometimes yellow and sometimes red, while the stigma-lobes, in the center, are always green. The irritable stamens are one of the provisions which nature makes to bring about cross-pollination. Bees visit the cactus flowers to obtain the nectar. When one of them settles upon the stamens, which spread widely apart in bright sunlight, these at once turn inward and downward, covering the insect and depositing the pollen on its back, legs, and head. This pollen is then carried by the insect to the next flower and dropped upon its stigma-lobes. Below the bright-colored petals is the spiny ovary, which ripens into a dry, many-seeded fruit, this pricklypear being one of the few which are not juicy.
The Missouri pricklypear may be found in dry places from New Mexico, Missouri, and Wisconsin to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet, a locality near the northern range of this species and also near the northern limit of the Cactus Family.
