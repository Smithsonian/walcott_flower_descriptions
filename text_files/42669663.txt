LEMON COLUMBINE
Aquilegia flavescens Watson
All our native columbines are graceful plants with beautiful flowers, and the lemon columbine is one of the most attractive species. When, in midsummer, at the height of its blooming season, it appears everywhere over the mountain slopes, it affords fine displays of color. At this season the pale lemon-colored flowers are contrasted with large purple asters and other brilliantly tinted blossoms. The flower stems rise eighteen inches to three feet above the fernlike basal leaves. This species of columbine is frequently found at high altitudes, and here the dwarfed flower stems are often only six inches tall. In cliff crevices, with gray rock for a background, it makes entrancing pictures for those whose eyes observe nature’s wonderful harmonies.
Lemon columbine ranges from Wyoming to Oregon and north to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Ptarmigan Valley ten miles from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
