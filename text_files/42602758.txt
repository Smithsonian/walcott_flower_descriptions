ROCKY MOUNTAIN CASSIOPE
Cassiope mertensiana (Bongard) Don
With the exception of the rare orchids, the Rocky Mountain cassiope is perhaps the most romantic of American mountain flowers. It is found in perfection about tree line in the Canadian Rockies, which is usually at an altitude of 6,500 to 7,500 feet. Here, in favorable localities, it frequently forms dense, thick mats, and when in full bloom the plants are literally covered with delicate white bells. The tiny stems holding the blossoms may be either green or red, and when the flowers fall the seed capsules are usually red in color, becoming brown as the season advances. Growth in a single season is rather limited, and the stiff, woody stems underneath bear silent witness to the vicissitudes of plants at high altitudes. To the camper a bed of cassiope is most satisfying, for in addition to its springiness it possesses an elusive fragrance that persists even when the plants are quite dried out. The red, pink, and white mountainheathers are frequently found growing with the cassiope, and add color to the wildflower carpet on the mountain sides.
Rocky Mountain cassiope is to be found from Montana to northern California and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained at Burgess Pass near Field, British Columbia, Canada.
