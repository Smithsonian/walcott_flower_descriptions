WESTERN RATTLESNAKEPLANTAIN
Peramium decipiens (Hooker) Piper
The common name applied to this plant refers to the resemblance of the beautiful white veinings of the leaves to the markings on a rattlesnake. It seems a pity to be obliged to include the word “plantain” in its name, however, for it is not in any way related to the weeds to which this name applies, being instead a delicate orchid. The technical name of the genus is not used in all books, some authors preferring to substitute Epipactis or Goodyera. The rosette of leaves is more conspicuous than the flowers, which are borne, usually, on one side of a stout stem. The plant loves decaying wood, and it grows frequently under evergreen trees where the air is cool and damp, though the soil is dry.
Western rattlesnakeplantain occurs from the mountains of New Mexico and California northward to British Columbia and sparingly eastward to the Great Lakes region, and even to northern Maine and Quebec.
We found it in the Selkirk Mountains twenty miles beyond Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
