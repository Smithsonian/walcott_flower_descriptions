SQUIRRELCORN
Bikukulla canadensis (Goldie) Millspaugh
‘Squirrelcorn is found in rich woods in spring, its beautiful, slightly scented flowers borne on a dainty stem well above the pale, feathery leaves. The curious rootstock is very distinctive, bearing many small, yellow tubers that resemble grains of corn. The leaves wither soon after the seeds have matured, in early summer. The plant belongs to the Fumitory Family, and is a near relative of dutchmans-breeches and the bleedingheart of gardens. Some writers prefer to use for the genus the name Dacentra.
Squirrelcorn ranges from Virginia to Tennessee and Missouri, and northward to Nebraska, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
