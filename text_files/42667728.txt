FRINGED POLYGALA
Polygala paucifolia Willdenow
Fringed polygala differs widely from many other members of its genus in that the flowers are borne singly instead of in cloverlike heads or racemes. Its lovely color and the dainty fringes on the central petal also differentiate it from other members of the group. It is a plant of acid soils.
Fringed polygala extends from Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota northward to Anicosti, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Pocono Manor, Pennsyvania.
