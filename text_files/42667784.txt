DOUGLAS HONEYSUCKLE
Lonicera glaucescens Rydberg
The Douglas honeysuckle is often found in the foothill valleys of the Canadian Rockies. In shade the flowers are orange, but they take a deeper hue of red or copper in situations mote exposed to the sun. The leaves of the uppermost pair of each twig are expanded at the base and united to form a shallow cup, from which the flowers arise. The stiff, woody old branches from which the flowering stems grow are firmly intertwined with the branches of their supporting bush. When growing in the open, the vine forms a mass of twisted stems near the ground. The green leaves make an exquisite background for the flowers.
This plant ranges from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma and north to Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was collected in July, on the shores of Lake Minnewonka, ten miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
