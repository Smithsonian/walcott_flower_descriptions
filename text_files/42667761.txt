GRAY PUSSYTOES
Antennaria howellii Greene
the showy flowers of spring abound, we naturally overlook the less conspicuous plants, but as the season advances attention is attracted to them. It is then that we notice the gray pussytoes growing on flats along stream beds, where the waters from melting glaciers have deposited some of their load of mud and sand. These flats support a luxuriant growth of coarse grasses, sedges, and willows. In midsummer they are overflowed in the afternoon of every warm day, and the soil is always moist. In such situations this plant thrives, often forming extensive colonies, which are propagated by prostrate leafy shoots that take root and form new plants. The “seeds,” also, are provided with a tuft of silky hairs, so that they are easily carried to great distances by the wind.
The range of this relative of the daisies is from Montana to Washington, and north to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched grew at Lone Tree Camp on the Siffleur River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
