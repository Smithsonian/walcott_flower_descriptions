COLUMBIA CLEMATIS
Clematis columbiana (Nuttall) Torrey and Gray
The fruits of the Columbia clematis, although not so conspicuous as the flowers, are quite as beautiful. The silky tails attached to the “seeds” of the loose heads become feather-like as they ripen. The soft shades of green grow paler and finally turn silvery gray, when the ripe fruits are loosened from the parent stem and carried away by the wind. Columbia clematis extends from Utah and Colorado northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was found in August in the Horse Thief Valley, Selkirk Mountains, British Columbia, twenty miles west of Athelmere, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
