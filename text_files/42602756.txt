IVORY BANEBERRY
Actaea arguta Nuttall
Ivory baneberry is a white-fruited form of the red-fruited western baneberry, Actaea arguta. It prefers shady situations, near the borders of mountain streams, where the soil is rich and the air damp. The flowers, which have a sweet, sickish odor, appear in spring in racemes two inches long at the ends of the slender stems. The white petals and sepals soon fall, and the raceme lengthens. When the berries develop and become heavy, the stems beating them appear almost too weak to carry the load, and the fruits soon drop when ripe. The berries are said to be poisonous, like the seeds of many other members of the Buttercup Family, to which the plant belongs.
Ivory baneberry is found from Utah and Colorado to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was collected near Vermilion Pass on the motor road between Banff and the Columbia River Valley, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
