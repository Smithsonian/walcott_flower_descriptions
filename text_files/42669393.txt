LAMBKILL
Kalmia angustifolia Linnaeus
Lambkill, although closely related to mountain laurel, is conspicuously different in its low stature and smaller but more brightly colored flowers. It is a beautiful member of the Heath Family. The shrub grows from six inches to three feet in height, and where it is plentiful, colors the hillsides or swamps with its rich crimson. The plant, as its popular name intimates, is very poisonous to stock, which sometimes eat the young leaves. Its poisonous properties were well known to the Indians who inhabited the Eastern States.
This species has a wide range. It is found from Georgia to Michigan and northward to Newfoundland and Hudson Bay.
The sketch was made from specimens collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
