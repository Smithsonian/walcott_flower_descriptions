PAINTED TRILLIUM
Trillium undulatum Willdenow
The painted trillium is one of the loveliest of the genus, differing from other species in having its soft petals decorated with lines of pink or wine color. In May and June it may be found in cold, moist woods in acid soil, where it delights in partial sunlight, before the foliage matures on the trees. The fleshy fruits are bright red.
Painted trillium occurs from Georgia and Missouri northward to Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Wisconsin.
The specimen sketched was obtained from eastern Massachusetts.
