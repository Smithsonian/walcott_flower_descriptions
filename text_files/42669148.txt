FOREST ANEMONE
Anemone deltoidea Hooker
This beautiful anemone grows plentifully in deep woods, sheltered from the hot rays of the sun. Its blooming season is much longer than that of most other western anemones, which prefer alpine meadows in full sunshine. The single flower grows at the end of the slender stem, and the pale yellow stamens and pure white petal-like sepals are very conspicuous by contrast with the shade and dark coloring of the forest floor. The species has creeping roots, and often grows in clumps. It belongs to the Buttercup Family.
Forest anemone has a narrow range, being found only in northern California, Washington, and Oregon.
We found our specimens in Mount Rainier National Park.
