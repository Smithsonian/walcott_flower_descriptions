AVALANCHE-LILY
Erythronium montanum Watson
Mount Rainier National Park is celebrated among flower lovers for the abundance of this beautiful flower. As soon as the snow melts, and even before it entirely disappears, the swordlike leaves push through the sun-warmed earth and almost immediately the flower buds unfold. The plants grow so close together and in such vast numbers that the drier meadows and slopes are soon white with the flowers.
The avalanche-lily has a restricted range, being found only in Oregon and Washington. It is closely related to the golden glacierlily of the Rockies, and to the troutlily of the eastern United States.
The specimen sketched was collected near the hotel in Paradise Valley, Rainier National Park, Washington, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.
