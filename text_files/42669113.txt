BUNCHBERRY
Cornus canadensis Linnaeus
To see bunchberry in its glory we must travel to the northern woods, where the cool summers and generally moist conditions of soil and atmosphere are most favorable to its growth. Here it covers acid humus with its bright green leaves, producing at the top of each stem a whorl of pointed, white, petal-like bracts. The flowers proper are the few inconspicuous purple or greenish tubular objects clustered in the center of these bracts. Bunchberry is closely related to the showy dogwood trees of more southern regions and in its way is quite as beautiful, in spite of its small size.
Bunchberry has a wide range, being found from the mountains of West Virginia and New Jersey to Maine and Labrador, and westward to Colorado, California, and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was gathered at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
