ALPINE MILKVETCH
Astragalus alpinus Linnaeus
Alpine milkvetch is found at high altitudes. It covers the ground with a mat of leaves, above which the loose bunches of delicate mauve flowers are borne in short heads. It delights in rocky soil in partially shaded situations. When found above tree line, the flower heads are borne on very short stems. The flowers show the plant to be a member of the Pea Family.
Alpine vetch has a wide range, being found from Vermont to Labrador, and from Idaho to Alaska. It occurs also in Europe.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of Johnson Creek, thirty miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
