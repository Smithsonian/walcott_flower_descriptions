AVALANCHE BUTTERCUP
Ranunculus suksdorfii Gray 
On the high slopes of the mountains, close to the melting snow banks, the avalanche buttercups grow, frequently associated with anemones, and contrasting their golden cups with the white anemone flowers. As the season advances, we find the buttercups only near the old snow of the avalanches, where the cold has delayed the unfolding of the buds. Warm days soon destroy the beauty of the flowers.
The avalanche buttercup ranges from Montana and Washington to Alberta and British Columbia.
Our sketch was made from a specimen collected on the slopes of Mt. Field near Burgess Pass, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
