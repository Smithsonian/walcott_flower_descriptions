ROCK WORMWOOD
Artemisia discolor Douglas
The wormwoods all have a pungent odor, especially when the leaves and flowers are crushed. Rock wormwood grows among the loose stones of steep rock slides. The plants are so nearly the color of their rock surroundings that they are easily overlooked. The wormwoods belong to the vast Aster Family, and to the subdivision that includes the oxeye daisy and yarrow.
Rock wormwood has a narrow range, being found from Montana to Washington, and northward to British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained by the side of the rocky trail under Mount Wapta, ten miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
