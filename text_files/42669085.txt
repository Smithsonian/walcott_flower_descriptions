LARGE PURPLE FRINGE-ORCHID
Habenaria grandiflora (Bigelow) Torrey
Large purple fringe-orchid is perhaps the most beautiful of the Habenarias. The delightful fragrance of its flowers appeals to us no less than their beauty, and we are not surprised that they attract bees and moths to their nectar and pollen. The plant prefers moist or swampy places in grassy meadows or in partial shade, where the soil is distinctly, though not very strongly, acid.
Large purple fringe-orchid is found from the mountains of North Carolina northward to Newfoundland and Ontario.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained on Mount Desert Island, Maine, where it grows abundantly.
