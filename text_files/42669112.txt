DOUGLAS-FIR
Pseudotsuga mucronata (Rafinesque) Sudworth
The giant Douglas-fir is an impressive tree wherever it reaches its full development. It grows from eighty to two hundred feet in height with a trunk two to eight feet in diameter, or sometimes even larger. The rich green foliage, pointed buds, and beautiful pendent cones distinguish it from its forest companions. The long bracts are conspicuous on the cones, since they extend half an inch beyond the scales. 
Douglas-fir is found from western Texas and northern Mexico to California, British Columbia, and Alberta.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Radium Hot Springs in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
