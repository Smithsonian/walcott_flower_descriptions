MAYAPPLE
Podophyllum peltatum Linnaeus
The mayapple is one of our familiar plants of spring, with its umbrella-shaped leaves and its cream-colored flowers hanging shyly below the forked leaf stalk. The flower is soon followed by an egg-shaped fruit which may be eaten when ripe, though the flavor is not especially good. Mayapples prefer a rich soil in partially shaded situations. The genus contains five species, all except this one being natives of Asia. They are members of the Barberry Family. The name mandrake, which belongs to an old-world plant of another family, is often misapplied in America to the mayapple.
The mayapple ranges from Florida to Texas, and northward to Quebec, Ontario, and Minnesota.
The specimen sketched was found at Washington, District of Columbia.
