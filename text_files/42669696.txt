SPOTTED BEEBALM
Monarda punctata Linnaeus
Spotted beebalm is one of the most beautiful members of the Mint Family. The delicate combination of color in its flowers is quite unlike the colors exhibited by most of its relatives. The plant has a strong flavor and scent, somewhat resembling that of mint but closer to that of thyme. It contains, in fact, so much of the valuable drug thymol that attempts have been made to grow it as a source of this substance. It grows mostly in dry, sterile, and often acid, soils, being found in the Southern States in pine woods, though in the West it is frequent on prairies. It is sometimes called horsemint.
Spotted beebalm is distributed from Florida to Texas and Kansas and northward to southern New York and Minnesota.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia, where it blooms throughout late summer.
