BRONZEBELLS
Stenanthium occidentale Gray
Bronzebells is so delicate and graceful a lily, and has such a modest coloring of green and dark maroon, that it is almost hidden among the vegetation of the moist rich woods, where it prefers to grow. Flowering in company with Rocky Mountain rhododendron and menziesia, it is always a delight to the lover of the beautiful who has eyes to see the variety in nature's handiwork, and will search for her hidden treasures.
Bronzebells ranges from Montana and Oregon to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Yoho Valley, ten miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
