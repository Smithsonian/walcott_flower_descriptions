TILLANDSIA
Tillandsia fasciculata Swartz
The tillandsias, of the Pineapple Family, are represented in the United States by about fifteen species, most of which are confined to Florida. All the members of the family are American, and in the tropics they are very numerous. The species here illustrated, like most members of the family, is an epiphyte, or air-plant, growing upon the trunks or branches of trees, usually in swamps, and deriving its food from water and decayed vegetable matter that lodges about its roots. The tillandsias often grow with orchids, and frequently have quite as showy blossoms. Their flowers, however, are extremely delicate, and wither quickly. The leaves usually are covered densely with minute scales, which give a gray aspect to the plant, and have been supposed to prevent evaporation from the leaves, but more probably serve to hold rain water while the plant is extracting nutrient substances from it. The numerous seeds are furnished with tufts of hairs, and thus are distributed widely by the wind.
This tillandsia came from Florida, but the species is widely dispersed in the West Indies, Mexico, and Central and South America.
