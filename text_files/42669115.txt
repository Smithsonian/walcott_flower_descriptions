WOODNYMPH
Moneses uniflora (Linnaeus) Gray
Woodnymph would probably escape the attention of the passerby, were it not for the pervasive odor of its flowers. Beautiful trails in the deep forest, where the sunshine filters through, lead us to the quiet spots where it grows in perfection. Half hidden by surrounding moss, with the stem turned down so that the flower is shielded from rain, it is seen only by sharp eyes. After fertilization the stem straightens, turning the flower upward.
Woodnymph constitutes a genus of its own, and belongs to the Pyrola Family—in fact, it is often known as the “one-flower pyrola.” It has a wide range, occurring from the mountains of Pennsylvania to Labrador, and from New Mexico northward to Oregon and Alaska, as well as in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was gathered in the valley of Baker Creek, twenty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
