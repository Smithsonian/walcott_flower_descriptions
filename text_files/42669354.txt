SIBERIAN ONION
Allium sibericum Linnaeus
Siberian onion is seen frequently in the higher valleys in the Canadian Rockies. When growing in rich soil with an abundant supply of moisture it is a showy plant. It occurs singly or in clumps, and is easily identified by its odor, which is similar to that of the garden chive, but more intense. It may be used for flavoring stews and soups, although with caution because its flavor is very strong. The flowers resemble tiny lilies, and as a matter of fact the plant is a member of the Lily Family.
This species of onion has a wide range, from northern New York to Maine, and westward to Wyoming, Oregon, and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
These specimens were gathered near Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
