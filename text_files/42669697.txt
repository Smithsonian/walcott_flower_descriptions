VIRGINIA SPRINGBEAUTY
Claytonia virginica Linnaeus
Springbeauty is one of the first spring flowers, blooming with hepatica, bloodroot, anemone, and troutlily. It grows from a small tuber, which is edible. The flowers open only in bright sunshine, closing at night and not opening again if the following day is cloudy. The three style branches of the pistil remain closely pressed together until the anthers have yielded their pollen to visiting insects; then the style branches spread to receive pollen from the later flowers.
Longfellow alludes to the springbeauty in “Hiawatha,” telling us that
Where the fire had smoked and smouldered,
Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time,
Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time,
Saw the Miskodeed in blossom.
This species of springbeauty ranges from Georgia to Texas and northward to Nova Scotia, Montana, and Saskatchewan.
The sketch was made from plants growing near Washington, District of Columbia.
