CREEPING JUNIPER
Juniperus horizontalis Moench
The shores of the Saskatchewan River, Alberta, are often sandy, and along them we found many shrubs of creeping juniper with quantities of blue berries adorning their branches. The plant flourished in spite of the blowing sands, which in these places discourage all but the hardiest vegetation. Creeping juniper is similar in foliage to the familiar red cedar of the East, but in habit it is very different, growing usually as a dense mat, flat upon the ground.
Creeping juniper has a wide range from northern New York, Maine, and Nova Scotia to Minnesota, Wyoming, Alberta, and British Columbia.
The branch sketched grew at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
