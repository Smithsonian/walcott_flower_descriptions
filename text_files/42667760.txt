CALYPSO
Cytherea bulbosa (Linnaeus) House
In mountain woods, where pine needles cover the ground and preserve the moisture underneath, the dainty calypso is often found, and is a joy to recall ever after. This lovely little orchid, waving with each passing breath of wind, is poised on a slender stem that seems too delicate to support its weight. The tiny bulb, barely half an inch thick, is much valued by the Indians of Alberta in spring as a delicious morsel, comparable to new potatoes. 
Calypso is a cool-climate plant, and occurs chiefly in the far north, or at high altitudes southward. It apparently survived the glacial period in the southern Rocky Mountains, in Arizona and New Mexico. Since the ice retreated it has been able to push northward as far as Labrador and Alaska. It is still found in the eastern United States in northern New York, Vermont, and Maine.
The specimen sketched was found in Glacier National Park, Montana.
