ROCKY MOUNTAIN KALMIA
Kalmia microphylla (Hooker) Heller
The dainty stems and flowers of Rocky Mountain kalmia cause that plant to seem far removed from its sturdy relatives of the eastern United States. It grows in swampy places near streams and alpine lakes, often forming masses of color among the moss, grasses, and other low-growing plants which love similar conditions of soil and moisture. The first hot days cause the corollas to fall, leaving behind them a cluster of red seed vessels. Rocky Mountain kalmia belongs to the Heath Family, and is closely related to Rocky Mountain cassiope, as well as to the pink and the white mountain-heathers, which often grow near it in somewhat drier soil.
Rocky Mountain kalmia has a comparatively narrow range, occurring from Colorado west to California, and northward to Alberta, British Columbia, and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was collected at Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
