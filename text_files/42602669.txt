VIRGINIA SPIDERWORT
Tradescantia virginiana Linnaeus
The Virginia spiderwort loves the rich borders of woods and thickets, and is loveliest in the morning, when its blue petals open wide, showing the golden anthers in sharp contrast. The plant continues in bloom for some time, new flowers opening each morning, and enticing the bees to a fresh feast of nectar. These insect visitors are necessary to cross fertilization, and carry from one blossom to the next a heavy load of pollen.
The genus is named for John Tradescant, gardener to King Charles I of England, and belongs in the same family as the dayflower.
This and the Pickerelweed Family are closely related.
The Virginia spiderwort may be found from Virginia to Arkansas, northward to South Dakota and southern New York.
The specimen sketched grew neat Washington, District of Columbia.
