GIANT ARBORVITAE
Thuja plicata Don
Giant arborvitae flourishes in rich, moist soil, and, as the name implies, the trees grow to great size. They frequently rise far above the surrounding forest, and their smooth columnar trunks, with pale, reddish gray bark, are very striking. The branches become pendent, from the weight of the fruit, and the little cones stand erect on the hanging twigs, presenting a very unusual effect. Both foliage and immature fruit are rich green in color.
Giant arborvitae is found from Montana to California, extending northward to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River Valley, thirty miles south of Golden, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
