SNOW WILLOW
Salix nivalis Hooker
When climbing in the higher altitudes of the Rocky Mountains, just above timber line, one often finds large patches of the ground covered with a low plant about an inch high, bearing spikes of tiny red flowers surrounded by small, dark green leaves. It proves to be the snow willow, one of the smallest of all the large group of willows. Later in the season the flowers are followed by tiny seeds with feathery appendages, by means of which they are carried by the wind to new locations far from the parent plants. The plant is so low that it is not torn by the winds, however violent they may become on the bleak mountain slopes. In winter, also, it is well protected by even the thinnest blanket of snow. Thus has the tiny willow become adapted to its environment.
The species ranges from Montana to Washington, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was found near Bow Lake, twenty-five miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
