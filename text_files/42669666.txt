QUEENCUP
Clintonia uniflora (Menzies) Kunth
The fruit of the queencup is not easily found. Although the plants often form dense patches, and the leaves cover the ground thickly, only an occasional plant bears fruit. The berry is of an exquisite blue color, almost black, and is said to be poisonous, although its unpleasant flavor alone would probably prevent one from eating it.
Queencup is found from Montana to California and northward to southeastern Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Kootenay River in British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
