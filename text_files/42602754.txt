SILVERBERRY
Elaeagnus commutata Bernhardi
We had known the silverberry for years and had enjoyed its sweet fragrance, but had never seen fruit on the bushes until one occasion when we were traveling down the Kootenai River Valley, in the beginning of September. Here all the plants were growing in great perfection, and in riding across a flat, through which a mountain stream meandered, we came across some superb silverberry bushes, which were higher than our horses’ heads and loaded with fruit. They were so beautiful that we carried a great bunch of them back to camp, tied to the pommel of the saddle. Since then we have learned that the berries are, in a sense, edible, though too dry and mealy to appeal to the taste of most people, and so the prairie chickens and other birds are allowed to enjoy them in peace, throughout their broad range from Quebec to Minnesota and Utah, and north to the Yukon.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Kootenai River Valley, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
