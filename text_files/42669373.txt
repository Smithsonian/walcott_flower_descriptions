PURPLE PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon lyallii Gray
Purple pentstemon is one of the finest of all the pentstemons, especially when it finds a congenial situation. In disintegrated limestone it thrives luxuriantly, often forming low dense clumps two or three feet in diameter and completely covered with large purple blossoms which resemble those of foxglove, one of its relatives. The flowers, borne at the ends of the stems, are so heavy that they weigh the branches to the ground. On slopes above timberline where it is subjected to severe climatic conditions it is very beautiful in contrast with gray rocks, especially when growing in rock crevices.
Purple pentstemon belongs to the Figwort Family and ranges from Idaho and Montana northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
We gathered them in perfection in Sinclair Canyon, near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
