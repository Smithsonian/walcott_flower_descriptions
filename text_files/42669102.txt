SCARLET ELDER
Sambucus pubens Michaux
Although rather inconspicuous in spring when its small, greenish-white flowers open, scarlet elder is a striking plant in summer and fall, with its bunches of brightly colored berries against a background of deep green leaves. The bushes are from five to thirty feet in height. Since they grow in rather barren, rocky places, and are not particular about soil or altitude, they have a wide distribution. The elders belong to the Honeysuckle Family.
This species is a rather northern one, ranging from the mountains of Georgia to those of Colorado and California, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Glacier House, Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
