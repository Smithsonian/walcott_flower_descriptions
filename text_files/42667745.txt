TAMPA EPIDENDRUM
Epidendrum tampense Lindley
It is only in Florida and westward along the Gulf Coast in the United States that we find the mild and moist climate suitable for the growth of epiphytic orchids, a group characteristic of tropical forests. In the dense cypress swamps of southern Florida, this Epidendrum grows commonly, the slender plants forming masses of hard bulbs and stiff fleshy leaves on the upper portions of the trunks and branches of various trees. The trees in the Florida keys and the southern parts of the mainland are often loaded with a dense growth of epiphytes, chiefly bromeliads, orchids, ferns, and mosses. In spring, Tampa epidendrum sends forth its graceful panicles of flowers, which are handsome, although inferior to some of the very numerous tropical species of the genus.
The Tampa epidendrum grows in southern Florida where the specimen sketched was collected, and also in the Bahamas and Cuba.
