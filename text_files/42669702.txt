RED TRILLIUM
Trillium erectum Linnaeus
In one pronounced character the red trillium is strikingly different from other trilliums, which have no well-defined odor. The strong offensive odor of this plant is repellent to the bees and butterflies, although it does draw the carrion flies, which have a monopoly of the pollen shed by the anthers.
Red trillium ranges from North Carolina to Tennessee and northward to Nova Scotia and Ontario.
The plant sketched was procured from the National Zoological Park in Washington, District of Columbia.
