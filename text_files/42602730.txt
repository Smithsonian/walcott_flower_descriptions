PINK FUMEROOT
Capnoides sempervirens (Linnaeus) Borkhausen
Pink fumeroot is a dainty wild beauty that loves rich rocky woods, where it grows in perfection. The leaves are a delicate shade of green, and the pale pink flowers, with a yellow lip, poised on slender stems, sway gently in the wind. The plant is a relative of the bleeding-heart of our gardens, and of the European fumitory. Like the latter, its roots exhale an intense nitrous odor, and the common name fumeroot refers to this characteristic feature.
Pink fumeroot has a wide range, from North Carolina to Nova Scotia and westward to British Columbia and Alaska.
We found it in the valley of the Kootenai River near the motor toad between Banff and the Columbia River Valley, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
