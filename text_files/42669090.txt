PEATPINK
Silene caroliniana Walter
The bright flowers of the peatpink are larger than the blossoms of most of our wild members of the Pink Family, and always attract notice among the spring flowers. The plants grow in clumps, and prefer dry, sandy or rocky, usually rather acid soil. The flowers have two sets of stamens, one set maturing before the other. The styles do not mature until the stamens have unloaded their pollen on visiting insects, which transfer it to the older flowers, thus ensuing cross-pollination. The flower stalks are sticky, so that small insects, endeavoring to reach the flowers by crawling up the stem, are trapped.
This species, termed in some books Silene pennsylvanica, ranges from Georgia to Massachusetts. A closely related species, differing in that the stems and calyx of the flowers are not sticky, grows from Alabama to Kentucky and has recently been named by Dr. J. K. Small, Silene wherryi.
The specimen painted was obtained at Washington, District of Columbia.
