MEADOW FLEABANE
Erigeron speciosus De Candolle
Meadow fleabane is a brilliant member of the Aster Family, and is one of a large group of closely related plants which attain their fullest development in the western United States. It grows in meadows and in moist, open woodlands. The flower head at the top of the stem is larger than the heads which expand later, and when the plant is at its best it presents a perfect bloom surrounded by several half-open buds. As the species is plentiful in favorable situations, it gives a gay aspect to the slopes in the lower altitudes of the Rocky Mountains in June and July.
Meadow fleabane ranges from Utah and Colorado to Oregon and Alberta.
The sketch was made from a specimen gathered at Ghost River, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
