AMERICAN WATERLILY
Castalia odorata (Dryander) Woodville and Wood
The lure of ponds and shallow streams never seems more insistent than when the waterlilies open in the early morning. Thoreau, speaking of the Merrimac River, says, “I have passed down the river before sunrise on a summer morning, between fields of lilies still shut in sleep; and when at length, the flakes of sunlight from over the bank fell on the surface of the water, whole fields of white blossoms seemed to flash open before me, as I floated along, like the unfolding of a banner, so sensible is this flower to the influence of the sun’s rays.”
Shelley also sings of their rare beauty:
**** floating waterlilies broad and bright,
Which lit the oak that overhung the ledge
With moonlit beams of their own light.
The fresh fragrance of these beautiful flowers is attractive not only to the flower lover but to the host of insects which visit them. The stamens and pistils mature at different times, thus cross-pollination is accomplished by the insect visitors.
The flowers may be pure white, or tinged with pink. The leaves, shaded with maroon on the under side, are almost as beautiful as the flowers.
The American waterlily is found from Florida to Louisiana and Kansas, and northward to Newfoundland and Manitoba.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
