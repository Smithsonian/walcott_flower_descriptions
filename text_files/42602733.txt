PUSSY-EARS
Calochortus elegans Lindley
We were following the old stage road, now replaced by a new motor road, in the Columbia River Valley, twenty miles south of Canal Flats, at an altitude of 2,500 feet. The marvelous larches and pines of the primeval forest towered above us, and over the grassy forest floor were scattered many flowers with which we were familiar. Suddenly we saw the grass dotted with a white lily, which was unknown to us, and upon examination we quickly comprehended the reason for its common name of “pussy-ears,” which our companion gave it. So graceful was it that we could only wonder that a flower so beautiful had not been enticed long ago to grow in our cultivated gardens.
Pussy-ears ranges from Utah and California to British Columbia and Montana.
