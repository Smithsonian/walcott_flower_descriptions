SASKATOON
Amelanchier alnifolia Nuttall
The saskatoon, service-berry, or June-berry, a northwestern species of shadblow, belongs to the Apple Family, and is usually a bush six or eight feet high, though when growing among other bushes it sometimes attains a height of ten or fifteen feet. The fruits are borne in heavy clusters, and when partly ripe are bright red, turning to purple when fully ripe. They resemble huckleberries in appearance, but are disappointing in flavor, especially when cooked. They may easily be gathered from horseback, and after a long ride are very refreshing. The Indians ate them fresh from the bushes, and also dried them for winter. In Lewis and Clarke's journal they are mentioned as being pounded into a pulp by the Indians, formed into loaves, and dried. These would keep sweet for the season and when needed, portions were broken off and cooked in stews. Birds and bears also enjoy these berries.
The saskatoon occurs in dry soil from Michigan to Nebraska and Colorado and northward to western Ontario, British Columbia, and the Yukon.
The specimen sketched was obtained near the Horse Thief River, one of the sources of the Columbia River in British Columbia, twenty miles northwest of Athelmere, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
