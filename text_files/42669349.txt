ENGELMANN SPRUCE
Picea engelmanni (Patty) Engelmann
Engelmann spruce is a majestic tree, sometimes growing to a height of a hundred and fifty feet with a trunk four or five feet in diameter. Its branches are produced in regular whorls. When growing with sufficient space around it, it is a handsome pyramidal tree, and in favorable seasons the top is adorned with masses of rich brown cones.
From Arizona and New Mexico northward to Alberta, British Columbia, and Yukon is the range of Engelmann spruce.
The branch sketched grew in the valley of Clearwater River, forty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
