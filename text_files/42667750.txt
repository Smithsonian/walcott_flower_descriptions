CANADA BUFFALOBERRY
Lepargyrea canadensis (Linnaeus) Greene
Canada buffaloberry is an inconspicuous shrub until the berries ripen, when it decorates the mountain slopes with its red or sometimes yellow berries. These are bitter in flavor, though useful to quench thirst, and were used by the Indians as a tonic. When the berries are mashed and water is added, they make a frothy mass when beaten, which some persons enjoy. Sometimes the name quassia is given locally to the plant. Horses like the twigs as a change from the grass and other green things that they eat on the trail. The flowers, produced in spring on the leafless branches, are small and greenish yellow. The leaves, which come later, are covered beneath with silver scales that are beautiful when viewed through a lens.
Canada buffaloberries may be found in the mountains from New York to New Mexico and Oregon, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.
Our specimen was collected near Hector Station, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
