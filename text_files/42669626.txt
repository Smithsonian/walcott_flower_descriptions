PLUME ANEMONE
Pulsatilla occidentalis (Watson) Freyn
In the long days of June and July the seeds of alpine plants ripen rapidly, and the flowers of the plume anemone soon are replaced by silvery gray-green seed heads. These are almost as beautiful as the flowers, and the head of silky seed tails, all smoothed sleekly from the center of the cluster, reminds one of nothing so much as the crown of a child’s curly head. When ripe the “seeds” are easily detached from the stem, the long feathery tail supporting them on their wind-blown journey in search of a favorable situation for germination. These seed heads are relished by the marmots, which eat them upon the spot, or carry them to their winter caches. The marmots also pile them into soft beds in their burrows.
This member of the Crowfoot Family ranges from Montana to California and northward to Alberta and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was collected near the summit of the pass at the head of Johnson Creek, Alberta, Canada, at an elevation of 8,500 feet.
