WAX TRILLIUM
Trillium album (Michaux) Small
Wax trillium is one of the trilliums which is little known and seldom seen, but for that very reason, it is of greater interest when found. Moist woods and thickets are its favorite habitat. Since it thrives in cultivation in a wild garden, as do most of its relatives, it may be enjoyed each succeeding spring. It may be a color form of the well-known purple trillium (Trillium erectum). It occurs as isolated plants throughout the range of that species, from the mountains of Georgia and Alabama to Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The trilliums belong to the Lily Family, and the numerous species occurring in North America are distributed from coast to coast.
The specimen sketched was obtained from a wild garden near Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.
