MOUNTAIN CRANBERRY
Vaccinium vitisidaea minus Loddiges
The fruit of the mountain cranberry is sour, but it is relished by birds, and its beautiful red color always attracts the eye. Where conditions of moisture and soil acidity are favorable the stems cover the ground in dense mats, and the berries attain twice the size of those on plants found in dry, sterile situations.
The mountain cranberry grows throughout the colder parts of North America, its southernmost known station being in northeastern Massachusetts.
The specimen sketched was procured in the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
