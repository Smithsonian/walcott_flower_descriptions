AMERICAN PASQUEFLOWER
Pulsatilla ludoviciana (Nuttall) Heller
The pasqueflower is one of the loveliest of the anemones. It is known commonly in the Canadian Rockies as “wild crocus.” In early spring the stalks push through the ground as soon as the snow disappears, and flower before the leaves unfold. In dry regions, like the upper valley of the Columbia River in British Columbia, there sometimes follows a second period of blooming, when rain comes in late summer after a dry season, but these summer flowers are inferior in size and beauty to those of spring.
The pasqueflower is really a prairie plant. It is found from Michigan and Illinois to Texas, Washington, and Alaska. It has been selected as the State flower of South Dakota. The sketch was made from a specimen gathered in July near the summit of Sulphur Mountain at Banff, Alberta, Canada, at 8,000 feet elevation.
