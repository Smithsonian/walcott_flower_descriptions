LODGEPOLE PINE
Pinus contorta murrayana (Balfour) Engelmann
Lodgepole pine is the commonest tree of the Canadian Rockies. In places where fire has taken toll of the primeval forest it is usually the first forest growth to obtain a foothold. Here it frequently grows in thickets so dense that they are almost impenetrable for animals after the trees have reached a height of seven or eight feet. When full grown the lodgepole pine attains a height of eighty feet, with a trunk one to three feet in diameter. If the trees stand alone their branches persist nearly to the base of the trunk. The tree is the one most easily available for tent or tepee poles, hence its common name. A striking feature of the tree is that the cones remain upon the branches for a long time, often for years after the tree is dead. The wood is light yellow or nearly white, soft and weak, and is little used for lumber. ‘The Indians, in times of scarcity of other food, sometimes ate the inner bark and soft sapwood.
Lodgepole pine ranges from Colorado and California northward to Saskatchewan and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was procured on the North Fork of the Saskatchewan River, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
