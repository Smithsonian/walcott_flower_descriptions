BLUEGREEN GENTIAN
Gentiana glauca Pallas
Several species of gentian are common in the Canadian Rockies, but the bluegreen gentian isa most elusive plant. I have found it only in the region of Ptarmigan Pass, where it is extremely local, inhabiting northern slopes, near the borders of alpine lakes. Following a trail that the horses had made in order to reach the higher meadows, where the sweet short grass was plentiful, we found the shy beauty. The plants grow singly or in clumps with three or four clusters of bluegreen flowers. The pale leaves form a rosette about the base of each blooming stem. The flowers are a peculiar shade of blue-green. They resemble closed gentians more than other members of the family found in the region, since the small pointed petals do not fully expand even with full sunshine. Blooming in August in the exposed situations that they prefer, above tree line, the plants are often caught by the early frosts, and thus are prevented frequently from ripening seeds.
The bluegreen gentian, sometimes placed in the genus Dasystephana, is found from Montana to British Columbia and Alaska, and also in Siberia.
The specimen sketched grew near a small lake eight miles by trail northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
