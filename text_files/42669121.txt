NODDING CAMPION
Lychnis apetala Linnaeus
Nodding campion grows among the rocks and boulders of old moraines or on alpine summits. Its flowers, turned toward the ground, are inconspicuous. The tiny petals project only a little from the end of the inflated calyx. Though the species has a wide distribution, it is seldom seen by the traveler because the coloring of both leaves and flowers is similar to that of the rocks among which it grows.
Nodding campion is found in both Labrador and Greenland, and extends from Colorado and Utah northward to Alberta, British Columbia, and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made from a specimen found near Lake McArthur, fourteen miles by trail from Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
