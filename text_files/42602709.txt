TRUMPETLEAF
Sarracenia flava Linnaeus
Anyone who has traveled through the South in spring and has been delighted by the fresh verdure of ferns and trees, cannot fail to have been attracted by the great numbers of these curious plants, which can be observed from the car windows. The trumpetleaf is the largest representative of the Pitcherplant Family, the yellow flowers measuring as much as five inches in diameter, and the yellowish-green tubular leaves, frequently veined with red on the pointed lid, growing two to three feet high. The inside of the leaves neat the top has a very smooth and slippery waxed surface, so that flies and other insects that are attracted by an exudation just above the waxed surface, lose their hold and slide to their death in the digestive liquid which the pitchers contain. All the members of this family have arrangements for utilizing the dead insects to their own advantage.
The trumpetleaf grows in damp acid soils, from northern Florida to the southernmost counties of Virginia.
The specimen sketched was brought into flower by Dr. F. V. Coville in a greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture in Washington. These plants are easy to cultivate if placed in a pot filled with acid soil made from a mixture of peat and sand, and this put into another pot of two inches greater diameter, the space between being filled with sphagnum moss. They should be kept in a cool greenhouse.
