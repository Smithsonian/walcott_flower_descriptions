BLUE-EYED-GRASS
Sisyrinchium angustifolium Miller
The starlike flowers of blue-eyed-grass open only in bright sunshine, and last but a single day. Thus in fields that were plentifully sprinkled with them in the morning, not a flower will be found among the grasslike leaves and stems in the afternoon. Its leaves although very slender, resemble those of an iris, being flattened and attached with their edges turned toward the stem. The plant is a member of the Iris Family.
This species of blue-eyed-grass has a wide range, from Virginia to Colorado and northward to Newfoundland and British Columbia. It has many close relatives, which can be distinguished from it only by botanists who have made a special study of this group.
The specimen sketched was gathered in the valley of Ghost River, thirty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
