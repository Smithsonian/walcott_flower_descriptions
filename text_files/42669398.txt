FLOWERING DOGWOOD
Cornus florida Linnaeus
Dogwood grows abundantly in the favored regions which it inhabits. When the tree is in bloom in early spring, the profuse blossoms appear like a cloud of great snowflakes falling through the interlaced branches. The large flower buds are well developed before the leaves fall in autumn. When warmer days have come the four small bracts, which protect the buds, expand into the white petallike organs which surround the yellow-green florets clustered in the center. The dogwood tree grows to a maximum height of twenty feet with a trunk sometimes eighteen inches in diameter. Its bark is gray and cracked into squares, and the wood is close-grained and heavy. Its firm and even texture, and its quality of drying without cracking, makes it a favorite wood for wedges in lumber camps and for spindles and bobbins in cotton mills. Dogwood is the State flower of Virginia, and no more beautiful and suitable plant could have been chosen. Occasionally the bracts are pink. Both color-types are extensively cultivated, thriving best in a moderately acid soil.
Flowering dogwood is found from Florida and Texas northward to southern Maine, Ontario, and Minnesota, and related species occur in the Pacific Coast States, and in Japan, Korea, and China.
The sketch was made in Washington, District of Columbia.
