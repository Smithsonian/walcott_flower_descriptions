GROUSE WHORTLEBERRY
Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg
The higher slopes of the western mountains, just below tree line, are often covered with widespread patches of grouse whortleberry. The dwarf bushes are only six to twelve inches in height, with shortly angled, slender green branches. The small, thin, finely toothed leaves are bright green. Underneath the foliage, and half hidden by it, hang the dainty little pink flower bells. The plants prefer well-drained, forested slopes, which are not too densely shaded, but they often grow profusely in even the denser forest. Like other whortleberries, and its close relatives, the blueberries, it is restricted to acid soils.
Grouse whortleberry ranges in the higher mountains from New Mexico to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Hector, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
