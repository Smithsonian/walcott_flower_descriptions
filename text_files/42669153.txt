ORANGE-EYE GLOBEMALLOW
Sphaeralcea davidsonii Robinson
The striking combination of color in the flowers of the orange-eye globemallow is their greatest charm. The center is a brilliant vermilion, and the cupped petals surrounding it are a beautiful soft pink. The grouping of the stamens in a sort of column is a feature which characterizes most members of the Mallow Family.
Orange-eye globemallow is found only in southern California.
The plant sketched grew at the Santa Ana Ranch, near Santa Ana, California.
