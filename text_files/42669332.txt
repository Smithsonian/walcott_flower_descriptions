RED COMANDRA
Comandra livida Richardson
Red comandra belongs to the Sandalwood Family, which has few representatives in this country, most of its members being shrubs and trees of the tropics. It is parasitic on the roots of other plants, and it withers immediately when gathered. The light green flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the fruits, when they mature in midsummer, are of a vivid striking red. Two other comandras with greenish or yellowish fruits are widely distributed in the United States.
This species of comandra has a wide range, occurring from the mountains of Vermont to Labrador, and across Canada to British Columbia and even Alaska.
We gathered the plant near Glacier Lake on the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise at an altitude of 6,000 feet, where this sketch was made.
