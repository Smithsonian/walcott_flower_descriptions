GOLDENBOWL MARIPOSA
Calochortus clavatus Watson
Growing on a tall stem, its bowl of clear yellow waving in the breeze, what could be more graceful and beautiful than the flower of the goldenbow mariposa? We are amazed at the variety of color, with endless gradations, in the members of this genus, variations that are increased in number by hybridization. This species exhibits even more strikingly than those previously described the relation of the genus to the tulips of Europe.
Goldenbowl mariposa is found only in central and southern California.
