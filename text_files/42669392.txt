PINK LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium acaule Aiton
Pink ladyslipper, often called moccasin-flower, is always a delight to the flower lover, for it seems like some exotic visitor. In fact it is not surpassed in beauty by many of the choicest orchids of the tropics. It adapts itself readily to cultivation in a wild garden if suitable acid soil is provided, for it is one of the most acid-loving of all our native plants. It reappears year after year when once established. The term acaule, meaning “stemless,” applies to the leaves and not to the flower, for the latter grows at the top of a slender stem — springing up between two broad green leaves which often lie close against the soil. It is the largest flower produced by any of our native northern orchids. Bumblebees are attracted to the nectar and enter the pouch, at the top of which it is secreted. Frequently, however, they find escape difficult, sometimes even biting their way out to freedom. Those which manage to emerge through the openings beside the anthers rub off some of the sticky pollen, and without knowing it, carry this to another flower and leave it on the stigma there, thus bringing about cross-pollination and the production of fertile seed.
Pink ladyslipper is found from the mountains of Alabama northward to Newfoundland and westward to Manitoba.
The flowers sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
