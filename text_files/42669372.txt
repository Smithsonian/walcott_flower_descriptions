CANADA VIOLET
Viola canadensis Linnaeus
Canada violet is easily recognized, because its habit of growth is different from that of most members of the Violet Family. The plants grow to a height of six inches or even two feet in favored situations, and the pale, rather inconspicuous, slightly scented flowers spring from the axils of the leaves. The Canada violet prefers moist shady places in the proximity of pines and firs, but it grows also in alpine meadows. Its flowering season is longer than that of most violets, lasting well into the summer.
The wide range of Canada violet makes it a familiar plant to many flower lovers. It occurs from the mountains of Alabama and Arizona northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.
The sketch was made at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, where the plant was found at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
