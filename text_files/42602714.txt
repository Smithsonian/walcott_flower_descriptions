BURGESS MILKVETCH
Astragalus bourgovii Gray
Among the numerous members of the Pea Family this dainty plant is one of the most appealing. A number of stems grow from a central point and, falling carelessly all around, give the impression of a loose bouquet, the flowers, on their delicate stems, projecting beyond the leaves. The ponies like to eat them, and perfect specimens are difficult to obtain where horses have had access to the colonies.
Burgess milkvetch has a rather restricted range in the northern Rocky Mountains, from South Dakota and Montana to British Columbia. Usually it is found among partially disintegrated rocks.
This specimen was gathered at Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, on a northwestern slope, at an elevation of 7,500 feet.
