SHOWY MILKWEED
Asclepias speciosa Torrey
We are so accustomed to seeing the eastern milkweeds scattered along the wayside or among the denizens of waste places, or in the case of the butterflyweed in isolated clumps, that it was a surprise to find a whole field of this beautiful milkweed in the Kootenay River Valley. It seemed to have exactly the right soil as well as other conditions suited to its needs, and the heavy, waxy, sweet-scented flowers were attracting many bees and butterflies to the feast of nectar spread for them. The plants were fully four feet tall. Most of the flowers were of a delicate shade of pink, although the fresher blossoms and buds were claret-colored, or almost maroon. When examined with a glass, the highly complicated structure of the flowers can be seen plainly.
This milkweed ranges from Kansas to California and north to Saskatchewan and British Columbia. :
The specimen painted was found in the Columbia River Valley in British Columbia at Fairmount Hot Springs, at an altitude of 3,000 feet
