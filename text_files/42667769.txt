AMERICAN PASQUEFLOWER
Pulsatilla ludoviciana (Nuttall) Heller
The haity basal leaves of the pasqueflower, growing directly from the root, and also a whorl of stem leaves, borne at the middle of the flower stalk, develop quickly after the flowers have faded. The seeds, each provided with a curved silky tail, remain attached to the head until ripe, when they ate scattered by the winds.
The pasqueflower ranges throughout the prairie and Rocky Mountain States and the provinces of western Canada.
The specimen sketched was obtained in midsummer at Ghost River, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
