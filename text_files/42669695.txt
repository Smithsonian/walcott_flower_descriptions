DOWNY PINXTERBLOOM
Azalea rosea Loiseleur
Downy Pinxterbloom is a striking plant when in bloom, its masses of clear pink flowers attracting the attention of everyone. It decorates the landscape wherever it is found, and is especially beautiful as seen along narrow mountain roads. Here it grows in profusion in company with mountain-laurel and other acid-soil plants. It has a delightful odor. The shrub grows in a vigorous manner, and in favorable locations reaches a height of fifteen feet. It is often called erroneously honeysuckle. It is easily cultivated in suitable soils, and should be planted freely by those who love our native shrubs.
Downy Pinxterbloom extends from the mountains of Virginia westward to Missouri and north to New Hampshire and Southern Quebec.
The specimen sketched was brought into bloom in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington.
