SMALL CRANBERRY
Oxycoccus palustris Persoon
The small cranberry is a typical boreal plant, and no doubt survived the glacial period close to the margin of the ice sheet, or on mountain summits which projected above the ice. Upon the retreat of the glaciers the plant migrated from its places of refuge into the many bogs formed by the damming of rivulets. It now ranges throughout the glaciated territory of the Northern Hemisphere, extending well into the Arctic region. In North America it is found as far south as New Jersey, Michigan, and the State of Washington. The cranberries belong to the Blueberry Family. By many botanists they are referred to the genus Vaccinium, which contains the blueberries and whortleberries.
The specimen sketched grew at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, near the point where Lake Louise Creek flows out of the lake, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
