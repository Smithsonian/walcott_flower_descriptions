ORANGE POLYGALA
Polygala lutea Linnaeus
At many places in the Southeastern States the brilliant heads of the orange polygala stand out in bold relief from the background of grasses and weeds that surround them. The pine-barren swamps are its chosen habitat, and here it may be found in blossom most of the summer. Most of the North American plants belonging to the Polygala Family have inconspicuous flowers, often dull in color, but the flowers of this species are very showy. The roots of the plant, like those of many other species of Polygala, contain the chemical substance commonly known as “oil of wintergreen,” which can be recognized by its odor and taste. As this same flavoring substance is used in candy, the country people throughout the South know the species of Polygala as “candyweed” or “candyroot,” and chew the roots as a cure for coughs and colds. The medicinal value of this species is slight, although extracts of the roots of other members of the genus are used extensively in cough remedies.
Orange polygala ranges from Florida and Louisiana northward to New Jersey and Long Island.
The sketch was made from flowers collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.
