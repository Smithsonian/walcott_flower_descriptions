ROSETTE CINQUEFOIL
Potentilla uniflora Ledebour
Rosette cinquefoil is a plant seldom seen by the traveler, for it loves rocky places at high altitudes, to which it is hard to climb. It grows in tufts or bunches from a mass of stout, woody, interlaced underground stems. Its rich yellow flowers, so large in proportion to the size of the plant, remind one of a small yellow rose. The leaves of this species have three leaflets instead of the five or more possessed by most Potentillas. It belongs to the Rose Family.
Rosette cinquefoil ranges from Colorado northward through the Rockies to the Arctic regions and westward to Oregon. It grows also in Greenland and Asia.
The specimen sketched was obtained on the rocky slopes above the source of Ranger Brook in the Sawback Range, fifteen miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
