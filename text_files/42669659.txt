SAND PHACELIA
Phacelia linearis (Pursh) Holzinger
We found the sand phacelia growing plentifully on a mound of disintegrated limestone in the Columbia River valley. The plant has dainty flowers, which are larger than those of many other Rocky Mountain phacelias. It flourishes in dry soils, blooming freely with a minimum of moisture. The phacelias are exclusively American plants, belonging to the Waterleaf Family. They are most abundant in the Western States, but several members of the group occur along the Atlantic coast, and others extend southward to the mountains of Guatemala.
Sand phacelia has a wide range, from Utah to California, and north to British Columbia and Alberta.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Columbia River valley, five miles from Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 2,500 feet.
