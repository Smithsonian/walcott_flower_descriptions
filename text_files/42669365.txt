PERENNIAL GAILLARDIA
Gaillardia aristata Pursh
Perennial gaillardia is one of the gaudiest of the mountain flowers, and in its abundance and display of color recalls the familiar blackeyed-susan of eastern pastures. We often found the flowerheads so large and beautiful that the plant seems to have no need of improvement by the hand of man, although this gaillardia was brought into cultivation long ago, and is now a well-known garden plant all over the world. It prefers dry slopes and many fine flowerheads are often borne on a single plant. It belongs to the great Aster Family. This and other species of gaillardia are often seen in gardens.
Perennial gaillardia ranges from Colorado and South Dakota to Oregon and British Columbia.
This specimen grew near Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
