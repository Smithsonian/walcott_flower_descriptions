FLAME AZALEA
Azalea lutea Linnaeus
The flame azalea is the most conspicuous of the native members of this genus. Its brilliant orange or yellow coloring, frequently suffused with red, attracts attention even from a distance, and when the mountain sides are flecked with it, the effect is particularly striking. The green leaves, which are well developed before the flowers open, add greatly to the beauty of the plant. It yields easily to cultivation and under favorable conditions, when grown with other plants requiring an acid soil, is one of the loveliest native shrubs for planting.
Flame azalea is a typical member of the flora of our Southern Appalachians, ranging from the uplands of Georgia northward, and being abundant as far as West Virginia. In the mountains of Pennsylvania it is rare, and though reported many years ago to grow in southern New York State, it has long since disappeared from there as a native plant.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Linville, North Carolina.
