NORTHERN BUTTERWORT
Pinguicula vulgaris Linnaeus
The bright purple flowers of the northern butterwort suggest violets to the casual observer, but on closer examination the plant proves to be very different in its structural details. Its flowers are borne well above the yellow-green waxy leaves, which are greasy to the touch, and form a rosette at the base of the slender flower stems. Like rennet, the leaves of northern butterwort will cause milk to coagulate. The plant always grows in a wet situation, usually in alkaline soil, in swampy places, on wet, gravelly flats, or by the edges of streams. Butterwort belongs to a small group of insectivorous plants, related to the figworts, and with the bladderworts constitutes a special family.
Northern butterwort has a wide range, from Vermont northward to Greenland, and west to California and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia. Related species grow in the peat bogs of the southeastern United States.
The specimen sketched was found in the Bow River Valley, sixteen miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
