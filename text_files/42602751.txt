GLACIERLILY
Erythronium grandiflorum Pursh
The glacierlily seems to radiate the spirit of the high places, and with bright sunshine and pure air helps to entice the lover of nature to the mountain tops. Along the edges of the melting snow the pointed, green, daggerlike leaves push upward, often through the snow itself, and soon the flower bursts into bloom, exhaling a delicious fragrance quite distinct from any other we experienced in the mountains. Carpeting the ground with gold, the plant may be found even in midsummer, along with springbeauties, yellow violets, and buttercups, where the spring avalanches have lodged their load of snow and thus held the early flowers in cold storage. The name avalanche lily is often applied to it because of this fact. At lower altitudes it grows in greater numbers and with longer stems, but always with the same lovely coloring of brilliant green and gold. It is rarely found below an elevation of 4,000 feet.
The glacier lily is evidently adapted to grow in regions of heavy snowfall, and no doubt survived the glacial period close to the edge of the ice from Wyoming to Washington, having since pushed northward into the mountains of British Columbia and Alberta.
The specimen sketched was obtained on the slopes of Mt. Wapta, above Emerald Lake near Field, in the Canadian Rockies, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
