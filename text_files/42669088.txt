BLUE-EYED-MARY
Collinsia verna Nuttall
Blue-eyed-mary is one of the daintiest of spring flowers. In the Middle West it sometimes grows in such profusion that the meadows are blue with its brightly colored blossoms. The plant is fragile in appearance. Its flowers, although without odor, are visited by many bees. A member of the Figwort Family, this plant is thus related to the snapdragons, pentstemons, and monkeyflowers. It can be cultivated easily in rich, gravelly soil, and is a very desirable addition to the wild garden. Since it is a winter annual, the seeds should be sown in summer or early fall, but once established, it reseeds itself abundantly.
The specimen sketched was grown by Dr. Edgar T. Wherry in his garden in Washington from seeds procured from Cincinnati, Ohio.
Blue-eyed-mary ranges from Western Pennsylvania to Kentucky and Kansas, and northward to western New York, Ontario, and Wisconsin.
