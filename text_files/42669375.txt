BOURGEAU ROSE
Rosa bourgeauiana Crepin
If you happen to journey in June to the upper Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, you will be rewarded by seeing the wild roses in full bloom. In no other part of the country where we traveled, except near Banff, do they show such marvelous color and size, or grow so plentifully. Their delicious odor is everywhere. The sturdy bushes frequently grow to a height of four feet or more. Their woody brown stems are well protected by many slender down-curved spines. Four States have chosen the rose as their official flower—lowa, North Dakota, New York, and Georgia, but the particular rose so honored is not always designated. Georgia has chosen the cherokee rose, introduced long ago from China.
The Bourgeau rose is found from Colorado and Montana northward to British Columbia and Mackenzie, and rarely eastward to Ontario.
The plant sketched was obtained near Lake Minnewonka, ten miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4, 500 feet.
