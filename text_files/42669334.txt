REDSTEM SAXIFRAGE
Saxifraga lyallii Engler
When traveling over the higher mountain regions above timberline, we frequently found the sloping banks of the tiny valleys spread with carpets of redstem saxifrage. Where the soil was wet by drippings from snowbanks, the tiny red and white flowers, carried well above the tufts of leaves on their red stems, reached their greatest perfection. When clumps of parnassia are associated with them, the effect is beautiful indeed.
Redstem saxifrage is a plant of narrow range, being found only from Montana and Alberta to British Columbia and Alaska.
The flowers sketched were obtained near Baker Lake, fifteen miles by trail from Lake Louise, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
