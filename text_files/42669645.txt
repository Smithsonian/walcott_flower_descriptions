SIDESADDLE GOLDENROD
Solidago ciliosa Greene
Although sidesaddle goldenrod is a dwarf plant, it is a showy member of its group, for it has much larger flowers than most of the goldenrods found in the western mountains. It enjoys steep mountain slopes, where it is conspicuous among the many flowers that grow beside the trails. The flower heads are equally large when the plants grow at high altitudes, even though the stems may be only an inch long.
Sidesaddle goldenrod is found from Arizona and Colorado northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained on the trail leading to Burgess Pass about seven miles from Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
