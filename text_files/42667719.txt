TRAILING-ARBUTUS
Epigaea repens Linnaeus
Trailing-arbutus is an evergreen plant, belonging to the Heath Family, and occurs in rocky or sandy woods, especially under evergreen trees. The flowering buds are formed before the arrival of the cold of winter, and open with the first sunny days of spring. Hidden away under dead leaves, and frequently with their pearly flowers turned toward the earth, they are not discovered by the casual passer-by. It is frequently called mayflower in New England, and is the State flower of Massachusetts. Bryant associates it with the earliest spring flowers in his poem “The twenty-seventh of March.”
. . . within the woods
Tufts of ground laurel, creeping underneath
The leaves of the last summer, send their sweets
Up to the chilly air. . . .
while Whittier tells us of
Sad Mayflower, watched by winter stars,
And nursed by winter gales
With petals of the sleeted spars
And leaves of frozen sails!
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But warmer suns ere long shall bring
To life the frozen sod,
And through dead leaves of hope shall spring
Afresh the flowers of God.
Trailing-arbutus, when furnished with proper acid soil and suitable exposure, can be grown readily, and produces a fleshy, edible fruit.
The specimen sketched was found in Washington, District of Columbia, but the plant ranges from Florida, Kentucky, and Wisconsin northward to Newfoundland and Saskatchewan.
