ELEPHANTHEAD
Pedicularis groenlandica Retz
Elephanthead loves wet meadows and the borders of lakes and streams. It prefers the region about timberline, and in sedgy upland swampy places it supplies masses of rich color. Flowers, stems, and leaves are often of almost the same tone. The curious flower resembles an elephant’s head with the trunk raised.
This plant and a similar one growing in California have been referred by a few botanists to a distinct genus, appropriately named Elephantella, but the two species agree essentially in their flower structure with other members of the genus Pedicularis.
This representative member of the Figwort Family is found in Greenland and Labrador, and from the mountains of New Mexico and California northward to Alaska.
It grew in many places in the Ptarmigan Valley, fifteen miles by trail north from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, where this specimen was obtained.
