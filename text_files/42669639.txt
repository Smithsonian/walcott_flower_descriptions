WHITE DRYAD
Dryas octopetala Linnaeus
The flowers of white dryad are quickly withered by the hot sun of midsummer, their stems lengthen, and the twisted fruit head appears, later spreading into a ball of “seeds”. These are each provided with a silky tail, which enables the wind to carry the seeds to distant places. At a certain stage, before the heads are fully ripe, the ponies are fond of them. At this time the plants often give a misty pink color to the areas they occupy.
White dryad occurs on limestone soils from Labrador and Greenland throughout Arctic America, in the Rocky Mountains from Utah and Colorado to British Columbia, and in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Siffleur River, fifty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
