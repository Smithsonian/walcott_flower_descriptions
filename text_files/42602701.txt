DEVILSCLUB
Echinopanax horridum (Smith) Decaisne and Planchon
The devilsclub is a sturdy shrub, rising above the ground four or five feet on stout prickly stems. The maplelike leaves spread from the stems about a foot below the red berries, and hide the ground, so that one is not aware of its terrible spines until he tries to walk through a thicket. No heavy woolen garment or leather shoe is stout enough to withstand the bristling, hard, gray spines. Without the help of an axe and a strong arm behind it, the thickets of devilsclub in the Selkirk Mountains are often almost impenetrable. The scarlet berries are very showy in late summer.
This plant belongs to the Aralia Family, which includes other spiny shrubs, such as the Herculesclub of the southeastern United States, as well as ginseng and wild-sarsaparilla.
The range of the devilsclub is from Oregon, Montana, and Michigan to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
