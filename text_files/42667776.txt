SLENDER AGOSERIS
Agoseris gracilens (Gray) Kuntze
The fruiting heads of the various species of Agoseris are much more beautiful and showy than the flowers, which expand only in bright sunlight, and are often small and inconspicuous. In Alpine meadows the fluffy heads are very abundant. As the seeds ripen and are dislodged from the parent stem they are blown by the wind to favorable locations for germination. This Agosetis may be found from Colorado northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Douglas Lake Valley, twenty-five miles by trail from Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
