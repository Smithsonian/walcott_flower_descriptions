SAUSSUREA
Saussurea densa (Hooker) Rydberg
Saussurea is one of the rarer members of the Aster Family. It is nearly related to the thistles, but in habit of growth and in the size of its flower heads it is very different. It prefers stony limestone slopes of moraines, and is confined to the higher altitudes. The flowers growing in dense heads, are attractive to bees. After the flowers have faded the downy “seeds” form an equally showy flat head.
In the Canadian Rockies saussurea is a conspicuous plant because it is so different from any other flower. Its range is limited to that region.
The specimen sketched was obtained near the base of Tilted Mountain, fifteen miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
