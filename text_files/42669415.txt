SCARLET MARIPOSA
Calochortus kennedyi Porter
Scarlet mariposa is one of the most brilliant representatives of the genus Calochortus. Its vivid color is accentuated by the contrasting dark purple gland on the lower part of each petal. These mariposas, of which there are many species, greatly diversified as to the shape and color of their flowers, are very abundant in the foothills and on the mountain slopes of Arizona and California. Some of them extend far southward into the mountains of Central Mexico. The genus is one of the most characteristic western American representatives of the Lily Family.
This species has a rather narrow range in Nevada, Arizona, and southern California.
