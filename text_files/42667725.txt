DEERBERRY
Polycodium stamineum (Linnaeus) Greene
Deerberry is a bushy shrub which often is found growing with pinxterbloom and other heaths, and thrives under similar conditions of soil and exposure. When flowering branches are detached, they present a feathery appearance, but on the bush itself the numerous bell-shaped flowers, which hang below the stems, are often obscured by the profuse, pale foliage. Deerberry is referred by many botanists to the genus Vaccinium, which contains the blueberries and whortleberries. Its globular fruit, green or greenish yellow at maturity and often more than half an inch in diameter, is seldom eaten. It is sometimes called squaw huckleberry In the Southern States the species of Polycodium are called, erroneously,“gooseberry” and the fruit of a species with purple berries is very commonly eaten.
Deerberry has a wide distribution, being found from Florida to Louisiana, and northward to New England and Minnesota.
The specimen sketched grew at Washington, District of Columbia.
