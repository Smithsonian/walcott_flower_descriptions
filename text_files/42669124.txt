ALPINE POINTVETCH
Oxytropis podocarpa Gray
Rocky slopes above timberline yield many of the most attractive flowers, among them the alpine pointvetch. This plant overcomes the handicaps of its difficult environment by growing close to the ground, its woody root holding it firmly to the soil that has collected among the stones or in the crevices of rocky ledges. The graygreen leaves form a fine background for the comparatively large purple flowers, which also lie near the ground.
Alpine pointvetch belongs to the Pea Family. It occurs from Colorado to Idaho, and northward to British Columbia and Alaska, also in Labrador.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected at Wonder Pass, near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.
