SQUAWROOT
Conopholis americana (Linnaeus filius) Wallroth
Squawroot is a curious plant, suggesting in its appearance, because of the absence of green coloring, a fungus rather than a flowering plant. The thick and firm but fleshy stems often grow indense clumps, the flowers nestling in the axils of bracts and forming a dense spike. The whole plant is pale yellow or brownish, and gradually withers to a deep brown, the stems persisting until late summer, when the seed pods are matured. It grows in rich woods, often about the bases of trees, the flowers opening as early as April.
Squawroot ranges from Florida and Alabama northward to Maine, Ontario, and Michigan. Another closely related species is native in the Southwestern States and in Mexico.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
