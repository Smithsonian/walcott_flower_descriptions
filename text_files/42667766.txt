COLUMBIA CLEMATIS
Clematis columbiana (Nuttall) Torrey and Gray
Columbia clematis is one of the daintiest and most attractive of the mountain wild flowers. The scrambling vine grows gracefully over the rocks, or clings to some convenient support of bushes or small trees, the single purple blossoms lending themselves to the situation with the utmost freedom from conventionality. The stems are woody, and after the petal-like sepals fall the feathery seed heads are quite as attractive as the flowers. The blossoms are produced in spring or early summer.
Columbia clematis may be found from the mountains of Colorado and Washington northward to the Canadian Rockies in Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched grew five miles from Field, British Columbia, on the slopes of Mount Burgess, near the trail to Burgess Pass, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
