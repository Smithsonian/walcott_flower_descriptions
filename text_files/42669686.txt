SMOOTH YELLOW VIOLET
Viola eriocarpa Schweinitz
Among the host of violets, perhaps none is better known to the flower lover than this dainty yellow species, which grows so plentifully in its favorite habitat. A lover of low, open woods, it is early in bloom, and soon is past its full beauty.
Bryant alludes to one of the yellow violets when he tells us that
When beechen buds begin to swell
And woods the bluebird’s warble know
The yellow violet’s modest bell
Peeps from the last year’s leaves below.
The smooth yellow violet occurs from Georgia to Texas and northward to Nova Scotia and Manitoba, being thus somewhat more southern in range than its relative, the downy yellow violet.
The specimen sketched was obtained at Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.
