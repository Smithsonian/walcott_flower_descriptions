ALBERTA PAINTBRUSH
Castilleja miniata Bentham
No group of plants that we have observed in the Canadian Rockies exhibits such a wonderful variety of color as the species of Castilleja, almost universally known as paintbrushes, which are representatives of the Figwort Family. All tints from white, through yellow, green, pink, red, and winecolor, with every degree of shade between, are to be seen in nature's gardens. Some are dazzlingly brilliant, but others are softly shaded with the deepest color on the tips of the bracts forming the head. Even in the same species there is often a surprising variation in coloring, and isolated plants of forms with normally red bracts have yellow bracted spikes.
This species of paintbrush ranges from Montana and Washington north to Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The specimen painted grew near our camp on the headwaters of the Clearwater River, forty-five miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Albetta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
