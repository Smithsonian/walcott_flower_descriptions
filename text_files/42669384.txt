LOBLOLLY PINE
Pinus taeda Linnaeus
We are so apt to consider the various kinds of pine trees as similar and uninteresting, that when a loblolly pine is investigated in its blooming season in earliest spring, its curious flowers shedding their clouds of dustlike pollen are an unexpected novelty. Produced plentifully at the tips of the twigs, they are so abundant, as to give a brownish tinge to the whole tree. The embryonic cones are inconspicuous at this season, reaching their full size only at the end of autumn, but they enlarge after pollination has occurred. Loblolly pine is a large forest tree occasionally reaching a height of one hundred and fifty feet, with a trunk five feet in diameter. It springs up in clearings or in old fields and is often called oldfield pine. The long leaves are usually in threes. The wood is coarse-grained and brittle.
Loblolly pine ranges from Florida north to Delaware and New Jersey and west to Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.
The sketch was made at Beaufort, South Carolina.
