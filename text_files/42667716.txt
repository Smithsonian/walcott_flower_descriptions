BLOODROOT
Sanguinaria canadensis Linnaeus
Bloodroot is such an ephemeral flower that we must visit the woods at exactly the right time in early spring to see it in perfection. The warm sun brings it into beautiful bloom, and we find its colonies in rich moist woods. It has pushed through the covering of brown autumn leaves that have protected it through the winter. Like other members of the Poppy Family, it has an acrid juice. This is blood-red in color, staining anything that it touches. The Indians used it as a paint, while the white man’s children gather the roots and use them to color Easter eggs a soft brown hue.
Bloodroot ranges from Florida, Alabama, and Arkansas northward to Nova Scotia and Manitoba.
The sketch was made from a specimen gathered in Washington, District of Columbia.
