COTTONGRASS
Eriophorum chamissonis Meyer
In all parts of the Rocky Mountains of Canada one’s attention is drawn in mid-July to the masses of sedge growing along the wet borders of alpine lakes, oftentimes out of the water itself: If there have been a few dry days, the cottony heads are waving in the breeze, as it fitfully blows over them. Farther away from the lake shore the plants become scattered and lose much of the beauty that comes from a massed effect. Buffeted by mountain showers and winds, they are in their prime only a few days.
This species of cottongrass is found usually about timber line in the Rockies. It is a circumpolar plant, occurring in northern Europe and Asia as well as North America. On this continent it perhaps survived the glacial period in Wyoming and adjoining States, where it still grows, but since the ice retreated it has spread far into Alaska, and eastward across Canada to Ontario and even to New Brunswick.
The sketch was made from specimens gathered at Cotton grass Lake, north of Ptarmigan Pass, ten miles north of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, at an altitude of7,000 feet.
