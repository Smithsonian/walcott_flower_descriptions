SKUNKCABBAGE
Spathyema foetida (Linnaeus) Rafinesque
This first plant to flower in spring is easily found in swampy places, where the richly colored, hooded spathe is seen pushing its way through the moist earth, sometimes before the ground is free of snow. When one peeps inside the hood, the small flowers are found dotting the spadix more or less regularly. The rank insistent odor attracts many flesh flies. The leaves come through the earth before the flower has faded, and grow rapidly into showy, light green clumps, from one to three feet high. At this time the odor is very strong. The fruit ripens in September.
Like most of the members of the Arum Family, the skunkcabbage is rather southern in its distribution, ranging from Missouri to Florida and northward, locally reaching Minnesota and Maine, or even Nova Scotia.
The specimen sketched was found along Piney Branch, Washington, District of Columbia.
