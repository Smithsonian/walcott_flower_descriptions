BIG WHORTLEBERRY
Vaccinium membranaceum Douglas
Snow slides are not to be desired, but after they have mowed down the forest of the mountain slopes, exposing the ground to the full sunlight, a bushy growth springs up, three or four feet tall, with young trees interspersed. Among these shrubs we find whortleberry bushes, Rocky Mountain rhododendron, and other plants that love similar conditions of soil and exposure. Here in late summer a delightful feast is spread for the traveler, for the big whortleberry bushes are loaded with dark purple berries, some of them as large as small cherries. A large quantity may be gathered in a short time. The black bears also appreciate them, and often are met in these localities, sitting on their haunches and sweeping the ripe fruit into their mouths with their great paws. In autumn the leaves turn a deep red.
Big whortleberry is found occasionally in the Rockies, but reaches greatest perfection in the Selkirk Mountains, and is especially abundant at Rogers Pass and in the vicinity of Glacier House at Glacier. It ranges from California, Wyoming, and Michigan to British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Hector Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
