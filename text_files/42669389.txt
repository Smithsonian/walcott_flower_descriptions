YELLOW CUCUMBERTREE
Magnolia cordata Michaux
Yellow cucumbertree is one of the rare members of the Magnolia Family, its range being confined to the State of Georgia. This species has had a peculiar history, having been discovered by Michaux in the course of his famous exploration trips in this country in the latter part of the eighteenth century, then being lost to science for a long period, and rediscovered in the wild in recent years.
A fine specimen on the grounds of the Department of Agriculture in Washington always draws much attention, especially when adorned with its showy blossoms. The flowers resemble somewhat those of the tuliptree, which indeed is a close relative, but the cucumbertree flowers earlier in the season.
The specimen sketched was given me by the Honorable Henry C. Wallace, at that time Secretary of Agriculture.
