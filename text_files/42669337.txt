HELIOTROPE VALERIAN
Valeriana sitchensis Bongard
Heliotrope valerian grows plentifully in moist upland meadows, of on open mountain slopes, its tall succulent stems lifting the heads of white or pinkish flowers well above the surrounding vegetation. The flowers are very sweet-scented with a fragrance suggesting heliotrope and attract numerous small insects. If they are gathered and placed in water, however, the penetrating odor so characteristic of the Valerian Family becomes clearly noticeable and the water turns pink. The odor of the roots persists long after they are dry. Numerous species of valerian grow in the United States, especially in the West.
Heliotrope valerian is found from Montana and Oregon north to Yukon and Alaska.
The flowers sketched were obtained near Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
