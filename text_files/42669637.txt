SAGEBRUSH MARIPOSA
Calochortus macrocarpus Douglas
The genus Calochortus, comprising the mariposas, which are often called mariposa lilies or butterfly tulips, the globe-tulips, and several kinds of pussy-ears, contains about fifty species. Nearly all of them are so beautiful that they command the admiration of all who see them. Our experience with the sagebrush mariposa was a revelation of nature’s methods. Our camp had been pitched on a dry bench fifty feet above the Kootenay River near Canal Flats, British Columbia, where the sparse vegetation indicated a lack of moisture. One night a heavy storm of wind and rain came up. A few days later the miracle was manifest, for all around the tent the buds of the sagebrush mariposa were almost ready to unfold, and soon the plants were in perfect bloom. There are myriads of them in some parts of the Columbia River Valley, where the little prairies are colored purple with their flowers.
This mariposa is found in sagebrush plains from Montana to Oregon and northward to British Columbia.
The specimen figured was sketched at the camp mentioned above, near Canal Flats, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
