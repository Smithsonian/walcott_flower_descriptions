BUNCHBERRY
Cornus canadensis Linnaeus
When in August the bunchberry is in fruit, it is even more striking than when in flower, for the berries are exceptionally brilliant in color. They are relished by wild birds, though insipid and unattractive to our taste. Both stems and leaves also turn red, enhancing the charm of the bunchberry's home, in the shady places of the deep northern forest.
Owing to the wide range of the bunchberry, it is well known to flower lovers everywhere. From West Virginia to New Jersey it grows only on the higher mountains, but it descends to sea level from Massachusetts to Labrador. It is common also in the mountainous regions of western North America from Colorado and California to Alaska.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Hector, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
