PINK CENTAURIUM
Centaurium venustum (Gray) Robinson
The brilliant flowers of pink centaurium contrast beautifully with their gray surroundings, and are the more striking because the plants grow in bunches. The numerous flowers are large in proportion to the size of the plant, and the pea-green leaves are entirely overshadowed by them. The plant belongs to the Gentian Family.
Pink centaurium has a very narrow range, being confined to moderate altitudes in southern California.
We gathered specimens at Torrey Pines, near La Jolla, California.
