WOOLLY ARNICA
Arnica tomentosa Macoun
Woolly arnica is one of many species of this genus, which belongs to the Aster Family. It is a graceful perennial with large bright yellow flower heads produced at the ends of the stems. Like other parts of the plant the leaves are conspicuously woolly, hence the appropriateness of the name given to it. We found this arnica growing high on the mountainside where it maintained a precarious foot-hold in shallow soil in crevices of limestone rocks.
This species has a narrow range, occurring only in Alberta and British Columbia.
The plant illustrated was gathered in the valley of the Siffleur River, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
