ONE-LEAF BOG-ORCHID
Habenaria obtusata (Pursh) Richardson
This orchid is exceptional in having but a single basal leaf. The plant grows on the mossy banks of streams or in boggy places, delighting in the peaty soil, where other members of the genus Habenatia flourish. Its green color renders it inconspicuous and easily overlooked, especially when the larger, white, sweet-scented varieties are its near neighbors.
This species ranges from Maine, New York, and Colorado and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska.
This specimen was found at Hillsdale, eleven miles northwest of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
