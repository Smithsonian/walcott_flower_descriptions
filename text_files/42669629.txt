DOUBLE BLADDERPOD
Physaria didymocarpa (Hooker) Gray
The double bladderpod is a curious plant of unusual appearance. It thrives best in dry limestone soils on steep mountain sides, or in the deposits of glacial streams. The many pale blue-green leaves form a rosette upon the surface of the soil, from which spring the delicate gray stems bearing four-petaled yellow flowers. The root is long, thick, woody, and tough. In its aspect the plant suggests an alpine species. It belongs to the Mustard Family.
Double bladderpod ranges from Colorado to Utah and northward to Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The specimen sketched grew near Lake Tied seven miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
