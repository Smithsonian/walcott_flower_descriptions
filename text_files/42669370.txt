STRAWBERRY-BLITE
Chenopodium capitatum (Linnaeus) Ascherson
The flowers of strawberry-blite are small, greenish, and inconspicuous. The plant is showy, however, in late summer when in fruit. It produces quantities of globular, pulpy, berrylike fruits crowded on the stems, which appear too weak to carry such a heavy load. It is sometimes called Indian strawberry, although it is not at all related to the true strawberries, being a member of the Goosefoot Family. The fruit is not eaten, but the Indians used the red juice of the fruit as a dye.
This plant has a wide range, occurring from New Jersey northward to Nova Scotia and westward to Illinois, California, and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
The specimens painted were gathered by the side of the motor road in the Bow Valley between Banff and Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
