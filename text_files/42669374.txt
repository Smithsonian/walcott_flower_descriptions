BOURGEAU ROSE
Rosa bourgeauiana Crepin
The beautiful flowers of the Bourgeau rose are followed by the conspicuous red fruits or hips. They have a pleasant flavor, but are irritating to the human throat. They are a favorite food of many birds and small mammals. Formerly, before so many delicious fruits were obtainable, rose hips were used to fill tarts, and in northern Europe a kind of fruit soup was made from them. In the United States they were used in jelly by those seeking novelties of this sort.
The Bourgeau rose is found from Colorado and Montana, northward to British Columbia, Alberta and Mackenzie, and eastward to Ontario.
Near Sinclair Canyon, Alberta, where this specimen was gathered, they grew in large quantities at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
