GRAYLEAF FIVEFINGER
Potentilla glaucophylla Lehmann
On the higher mountain slopes we were always attracted by the cheerful yellow flowers of grayleaf fivefinger. The slender stems, rising well above a bunch of gray-green leaves, wave to and fro in the mountain breezes. The blossoms seem sometimes almost like a shower of gold, just reaching the earth from the clouds above. This plant belongs to the Rose Family.
Grayleaf fivefinger ranges from New Mexico to Oregon, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan.
The sketch was made at Lake O'Hara, eleven miles by trail north of Hector Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
