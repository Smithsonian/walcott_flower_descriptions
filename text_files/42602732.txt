FALSE LOCOWEED
Oxytropis gracilis (Nelson) Jones
This plant must not be confused with its relative, the true locoweed, that is so destructive to animals on the plains of the southwestern United States; it seemed entirely harmless to our horses, who ate it freely. In full sunshine its pale yellow or straw-colored flowers, borne on stems six or eight inches tall, are wonderfully attractive against their setting of sage-colored foliage. In limestone regions, where moisture is limited, the blossoms develop well only if an abundance of water is available at flowering time.
False locoweed is a member of the Pea Family. It ranges from Idaho to South Dakota and northward into Alberta, Canada.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Ghost River on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, twenty-five miles from Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
