PYGMY ANDROSACE
Androsace subumbellata (A. Nelson) Small
Pygmy androsace is a tiny member of the Primrose Family, which, because of its small size and inconspicuous coloring, easily escapes notice. It grows in meadows or on stony alpine slopes. The delicate slender stems and white flowers give it a graceful and dainty appearance quite in contrast to that of the sweet androsace, previously pictured.
Pygmy androsace ranges from New Mexico and Arizona northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected near the headwaters of Johnson Creek, thirty miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
