BLUEFLAG IRIS
Iris versicolor Linnaeus
Blueflag iris loves swamps and wet meadows because it requires ample moisture in order to flourish. Its blue flowers attract bees and other insects; these are necessary to the formation of viable seeds, for the shape and arrangement of the petals are such as to make self pollination impossible. The thick root is considered poisonous, and although this is not fully substantiated, the foliage evidently contains a repellent, for cattle never eat it. The irises derive their name from the Greek word meaning rainbow.
Blueflag iris has a wide range, growing from the mountains of North Carolina northward to Newfoundland. Closely related species also occur in adjoining territory.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
