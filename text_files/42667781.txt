CLASPING TWISTEDSTALK
Streptopus amplexifolius (Linnaeus) De Candolle
The clasping twistedstalk is similar in habit to the pink twistedstalk, but the flowers are greenish white. The whole plant is of greater size, often growing to a height of three feet, and the stems commonly are branched, except above tree line, where the plants are dwarfed by the cold. The berries of this species are also more conspicuous, oval in form and bright red in color, and freely produced along the stems. The stalks on which they are borne are twisted or sharply curved, hence the common name. The plant loves a moist rich soil in wooded places, where its lush growth and contrasting colors are attractive to the eye.
This member of the Lily-of-the-valley Family is found from the high mountains of North Carolina to New Mexico and northward to Greenland and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was found near Hector Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
