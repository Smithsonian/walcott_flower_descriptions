ATAMASCO-LILY
Atamosco atamasco (Linnaeus) Greene
Springing from the brown bed of the southern forest, no lovelier flower graces the awakening of spring than the atamasco-lily, a member of the Amaryllis Family. Blooming as it does in many places about Easter time, it is widely known in the South as “Easter lily.” Great bunches of the flowers are gathered to decorate homes and churches, but since the bulbs are not disturbed, the plants are not injured. A few long grass-like leaves grow from the bulb, and above them the flower stem, bearing the beautiful white flower, which sometimes is shaded delicately with pale pink. The thrill that comes when the flowers are discovered for the first time will long be remembered, for a patch of moist open woods starred with hundreds of the blossoms is a beautiful sight.
Atamasco-lily ranges from Florida and Alabama northward to southeastern Virginia. It has been reported also from Pennsylvania, but has not been found in that state in recent years. By some botanists the plant is known as Zephyranthes atamasco.
The flowers sketched were obtained near Yemassee, South Carolina.
