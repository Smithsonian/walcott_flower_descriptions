ROSE PAINTBRUSH
Castilleja pallida (Linnaeus) Kunth
Crossing alpine meadows above tree line and on high passes in the Canadian Rockies, one often finds the drier ground covered with masses of rose paintbrush, growing in company with saxifrages and forgetme-nots, wherever soil resulting from the disintegrating rock has been deposited. The rose paintbrush varies from two to eight inches in height, according to altitude and local conditions. The leafy bracts, often mistaken for petals, range in color from greenish-white or pale yellow to various shades of mulberry or dull pink. The actual flowers have a dull-colored corolla, and are concealed between the bracts. The plant belongs to the Figwort Family.
Rose paintbrush grows from Alberta and British Columbia to Alaska, and also in Siberia.
The specimen sketched was obtained on the Clearwater River thirty miles north of Lake Louise Station in British Columbia, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.
