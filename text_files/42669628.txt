STAR SOLOMONPLUME
Vagnera stellata (Linnaeus) Morong
Star solomonplume loves moist rich woods. In its habit of growth and in the appearance of the flowers it recalls vaguely the lily-of-the-valley. By their rootstocks the plants spread widely, forming extensive patches in the woodlands. The rootstocks show no trace of the seal-like scars so characteristic of the solomonseals. The plant is graceful in form, and beautiful when in either flower or fruit. It belongs to the Lily-of-the-valley Family, which includes asparagus, lily-of-the-valley, and merrybells. The fruit is a small globular berry, at first green, with three dark vertical stripes, but turning black when quite ripe. Some botanists use the name Smilacina stellata for this plant.
Star solomonplume ranges from Virginia to New Mexico and California, and northward to Newfoundland and Alaska. It grows also in northern Europe.
The specimen sketched was obtained at Lake Minnewonka, near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
