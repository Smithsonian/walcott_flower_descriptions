SUN-DIAL LUPINE
Lupinus perennis Linnaeus
Sun-dial lupine in the East seldom equals in profusion of growth its sisters of the West, which often cover the hillsides with a carpet of bloom. Nevertheless, this common species of the Eastern States is as beautiful as any of the others, and deserves a place of honor in our wild gardens. In rich loam it will dwindle and die, but if planted in an acid, sandy soil, will thrive in cultivation. Although usually bright blue, the flowers are occasionally white or lavender, sometimes bordering on purple.
In Texas, one of the lupines commonly called blue-bonnets has been named the State flower.
The sun-dial lupine is found from Louisiana and Florida north to Maine and Minnesota.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
