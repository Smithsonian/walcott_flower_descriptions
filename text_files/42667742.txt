AMERICAN WISTARIA
Kraunhia frutescens (Linnaeus) Greene
American wistaria is a woody vine, climbing over trees and bushes. Its stem teaches several inches in diameter and as much as forty feet in length. The showy blue or lilac flowers are borne in abundance, though the racemes are shorter than those of the Chinese wistaria so frequently seen in our gardens. Wistaria was named in memory of Dr. Caspar Wistar of Philadelphia.
American wistaria is found in low grounds from Texas to Arkansas and Florida and northward to Virginia.
The specimen sketched grew near Savannah, Georgia.
