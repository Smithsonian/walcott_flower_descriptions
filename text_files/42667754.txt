BEARBERRY
Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Linnaeus) Sprengel
This shrubby member of the Heath Family is seldom seen in bloom by the traveler. Early in the season, soon after the snow melts, the flowers may be found hidden under the mass of beautiful evergreen leaves. They prefer a dry, gravelly, or sandy soil. The leaves were used by the Indians either in combination with tobacco, or by themselves, for smoking purposes. The plant has also been used in medicine as an astringent, as well as by tanners in making leather.
Bearberry, or kinnikinnick, may be found from New Jersey to New Mexico and California, and northward to Labrador and Alaska.
The sketch was made from a specimen secured near Mount Assiniboine, fifty miles south of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
