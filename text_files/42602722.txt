VERNAL IRIS
Iris verna Linnaeus
Although the vernal iris is not very well known, it is so lovely a wildling that it should find a home in our wildflower gardens. In his “Book of the Iris”, Dykes reports his inability to cultivate it, but this was probably owing to his failure to recognize its peculiar soil requirements. It usually grows on wooded hillsides, preferring a mediacid soil. Though the whole plant is only about six inches tall, its violet-blue flowers with yellow markings at the base of the petals cannot be easily overlooked, for they are very large in proportion to the grasslike leaves. In early spring the blossoms dot the barren fields of the Southern States, where real blue violets do not occur, and are often called “violets.” Curiously enough, their delicate fragrance adds to the deception, for it closely resembles the scent of the garden violet.
This iris ranges over most of Alabama and Georgia and the states adjoining them on the north, but farther northward it becomes rare, occurring in but a few favored localities in Kentucky, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
The specimen painted was found near Beaufort, South Carolina.
