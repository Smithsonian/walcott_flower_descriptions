GLOBE ANEMONE
Anemone globosa Nuttall
This beautiful flower is often the first anemone seen by the flower lover whose Western journey is taken in midsummer, when the early anemones are past flowering. The plants grow in clumps, the flowers borne on stout stems well above the gray-green foliage and colored pink, red, white, or sometimes lavender. A thimble-like seed-head follows the flowers, and this soon develops into a fluffy mass, each seed being provided with cottony hairs by which the wind transports it to a new location. The anemones belong to the Crowfoot Family.
Globe anemone occurs from New Mexico and California northward to South Dakota, Mackenzie, and Alaska. It is very plentiful in some of the dry meadows near Banff.
The sketch was made from specimens gathered near Mt. Massive, ten miles west of Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
