BOTTLE GENTIAN
Gentiana saponaria Linnaeus
In autumn, long after most of our flowers except goldenrods and asters have faded, the bottle gentian is found in blossom in the thickets bordering woodlands. Unlike its better-known relative, the fringed gentian, it is a perennial, and may be sought with some confidence year after year in the same locality. Its richly colored flowers, of a hue rare at any season, are a delight to the eye when other flowers are so scarce. Blue and purple flowers often have albino forms, and the bottle gentian is no exception, as plants with pure white corollas are not unusual.
Bottle gentian ranges from Florida and Louisiana northward to Connecticut and Ontario, and closely related species are even more widely distributed.
The specimen sketched came from the vicinity of Washington, District of Columbia.
