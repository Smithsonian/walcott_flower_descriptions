CROWPOISON
Chrosperma muscaetoxicum (Walter) Kuntze
Crowpoison is found in sandy woods. It has a graceful and attractive spike of creamy white flowers and buds, the lower ones expanding first. It grows from a bulb nearly an inch in diameter, and blooms from May to July. The seeds are reddish brown, and this fact gives the motive for the generic name, derived from the Greek and referring to the colored seeds. The genus consists of a single species. This plant is remarkable in that it contains one of the most toxic alkaloids known to science. In the Southern Appalachians it often poisons cattle, which mistake its leaves for grass in the spring. In this respect it recalls its relationship to the western deathcamas, another member of the Bunchflower Family.
Crowpoison ranges from Florida to Tennessee and Arkansas and northward to Virginia and Long Island.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
