ROUNDLEAF ORCHIS
Orchis rotundifolia Pursh
The roundleaf orchis loves the wet shores of alpine lakes and frequently grows in sphagnum moss along the borders of mountain brooks in partially shaded, wet places. Where conditions are favorable it occurs in abundance, though often overlooked by the flower lover because of larger and tanker plants surrounding it. The single rounded leaf is a distinguishing characteristic, and the sweet scent of the flowers is so pervasive that it sometimes attracts attention before the bloom is discovered. Except for a single Alaskan species, it is the only American member of a group represented in Europe and Asia by eighty species or more.
The roundleaf orchis is a plant of northern range and is not known to grow south of the limits reached by the ice sheets of the glacial period. It must have survived close to the edge of the ice, and migrated back rapidly when this retreated. Although it died out from the places where it survived glaciation, it has subsequently spread across the continent, from northern Maine to British Columbia and northward to Greenland and Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew at Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,800 feet.
