MOUNTAIN-LAUREL
Kalmia latifolia Linnaeus
Mountain-laurel is a joy to the flower lover, not only when its beautiful blooms are plentiful in late spring, but also during the other months of the year, when its glossy evergreen leaves lend themselves so readily to the decoration of our homes. The intricate structure of the flowers is very curious. Each anther is tucked into a pocket on the inside of the corolla. When a bee probes the nectaries at the base of the flower tube the anthers are released and spring upward, emptying their pollen pouches upon the bee, which carries the pollen to the stigma of the next flower visited, thus effecting cross-pollination. The flower stalks are hairy and sticky and consequently entrap many ants and other small insects which are not useful in pollination. Honey made from mountain-laurel nectar is poisonous, and the leaves are deadly to stock. The heavy, hard, and tough wood is in demand for the manufacture of small articles.
Mountain-laurel prefers sandy or rocky, acid soil. It frequently forms densely interlaced thickets and sometimes grows to a height of twenty feet. Rarely it is a tree as high as forty feet, with a trunk diameter of eighteen inches. Mountain-laurel was taken to Europe about 1750 by Peter Kalm, the Swedish explorer. He was a friend of Linnaeus, who gave the shrub the name Kalmia in his honor. It is the State flower of Connecticut.
Mountain-laurel extends from Florida to Louisiana, western Kentucky, and Indiana, and northward to Ontario and New Brunswick.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.
