NORTHERN BUTTERBUR
Petasites hyperboreus Rydberg
Northern butterbur is rarely seen in bloom by visitors to the Canadian Rockies, because it flowers very early in the season. The silky seed heads topping its stout woolly stems are not likely to attract attention. If, in summer, one is fortunate enough to find a sheltered spot where the ice and snow have recently melted, the northern butterbur is sometimes found in flower, grouped with springbeauties and buttercups, in swampy soil or near snow water rivulets. The flowers are sweet-scented, and brightly colored. The ponies dearly love to eat the plant to vary still further their diet of “all sorts of feed”.
This species of butterbur ranges from the mountains of Washington and Alberta northward to the Arctic Coast, from Hudson Bay to Alaska.
The specimen sketched was found at Vermilion Pass, thirty-five miles south of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
