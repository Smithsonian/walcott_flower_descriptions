EVENING-PRIMROSE
Pachyloplus hirsutus Rydberg
When traveling along the highway toward the Roosevelt Dam in Arizona I saw a plant about eighteen inches tall growing from a crevice in the rocks. It was full of buds as well as withered flowers, rising among masses of long green leaves. When the plant was lifted it was carried for several days awaiting an opportunity to sketch it. One evening on returning to the hotel for dinner, I noticed, on entering the room, a delightful odor like that of a night-blooming cereus, and the plant was discovered in full bloom. The sketch fortunately was made that evening, by electric light, for the next morning all the flowers had withered.
This species of evening-primrose ranges from Arizona and New Mexico to Wyoming.
