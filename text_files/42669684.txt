GOLDENCLUB
Orontium aquaticum Linnaeus
Goldenclub is not so handsome as many members of the Arum Family, but when the plants grow in large colonies their many bright yellow spikes are showy. Each spike is composed of innumerable tiny flowers. The plant attracts gnats and small insects, which are instrumental in fertilizing the flowers. It grows in open swamps and on the muddy borders of streams.
The range of the goldenclub is from Louisiana to Florida and northward to Massachusetts, chiefly near the coast.
The specimen sketched was procured near Beaufort, South Carolina.
