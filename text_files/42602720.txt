WHITE TROUTLILY
Erythronium albidum Nuttall
White troutlily is one of the daintiest of our early spring flowers, and east of the Appalachian Mountains is much rarer than the yellow species, which it closely resembles in habit. The shining green leaves are marked with pale mottlings of brownish purple, or in exceptional plants are entirely green. The flowers open only in bright sunlight, and speedily close and wither when gathered. It is known in some sections as dogtooth violet, but as it has no relation to the Violet Family, the name troutlily, suggested by John Burroughs, seems most appropriate.
White troutlily is the common species in the Middle West, from Texas to Minnesota, and eastward to the Appalachian Mountain region. Here and there its seeds have chanced to cross the mountain barrier and, carried down the streams, have lodged along the banks and established colonies in the Piedmont regions from Georgia to northern New Jersey.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Potomac Valley above Washington, District of Columbia.
