CANADA WILDGINGER
Asarum canadense Linnaeus
Canada wildginger is one of our earliest spring flowers. Owing to its habit of growth, the flowers, hidden by dead leaves of the preceding autumn, are easily overlooked. The rootstocks have the pungent flavor of ginger, but the juice of the leaves and stems is bitter. Lying so close to the ground, and thus sheltered from the winds, the flowers are a refuge for small flies which serve to pollinate them.
Canada wildginger prefers rich woods, and ranges from North Carolina to Missouri and Kansas, and northward to New Brunswick and Manitoba.
The sketch was made from a plant that grew on Plummers Island, in the Potomac River, near Washington, District of Columbia.
