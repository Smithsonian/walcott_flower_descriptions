FLOWERING DOGWOOD
Cornus florida Linnaeus
As autumn approaches, the leaves of the dogwood assume gorgeous tints of crimson and yellow, and at the same season the clusters of brilliant red berries reach their maturity. Robins and many other birds are especially fond of the juicy though bitter berries, and frequently they eat them all before winter comes. The seeds are stored by small mammals for winter use. Sometimes the fruits remain on the tree until far into the winter. In late autumn, in some places, they are so abundant as to give a red color to the woods.
Dogwood is found from Florida to Texas, and northward to southern Maine, Ontario, and Minnesota.
The branch illustrated grew near Fairfax, Virginia, a region where the berries are exceptionally large and well developed.
