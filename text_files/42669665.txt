QUEENCUP
Clintonia uniflora (Menzies) Kunth
Queencup is a lovely member of the Lily Family. It is found only in places where conditions are exactly to its liking, delighting in dense shade under the trees where mosses flourish and the earth is always cool and moist. The single flower stem rises between a pair of deep green leaves, similar to those of lily-of-the-valley, and beats a single pure white flower with yellow stamens.
Queencup ranges from Montana to California, and north to southeastern Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew near Emerald Lake, seven miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
