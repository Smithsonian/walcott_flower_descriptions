DUTCHMANS-BREECHES
Bikukulla cucullaria (Linnaeus) Millspaugh
The peculiarly delicate flowers of dutchmans-breeches, held aloft above the lacelike leaves by a slender stem, are one of the delights of flower lovers in early spring. This plant prefers rich soil on rocky ledges or well-drained wooded slopes. The leaves wither when the warm days of late spring come. The plant was valued as a love charm by the North American Indians. Recent tests made by the United States Department of Agriculture trace many cases of stock poisoning to this plant. The leaves, unfolding before there is much other green vegetation, are eaten greedily by cattle, and since the plant grows in leafmold, with slight hold in the earth, it is easily pulled loose, and the tubers as well as the leaves are eaten by the animal. This double dose of the toxic substance, which is contained in all parts of the plant, often produces fatal results. The Virginia highlanders know the plant as “little staggerweed.” It belongs to the Fumitory Family. Many authors use the name Dicentra for the genus. The flowers of this species are usually white, but pink-flowered plants are found occasionally, especially in the southwestern part of its range.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.
Dutchmans-breeches has a wide range, occurring from North Carolina to Kansas, and north to Minnesota and Nova Scotia.
