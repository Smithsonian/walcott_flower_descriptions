WESTERN LARCH
Larix occidentalis Nuttall
One of the stateliest trees in our northwestern country is western larch, which gives a distinctive appearance to the forests where it is found. The tall, straight trunks, often three feet in diameter, reach a height of a hundred feet or more, rising above the surrounding trees. The wood is very durable, which makes it especially suitable for railroad ties. In consequence, the large trees are being cut rapidly.
Western larch ranges from western Montana to Oregon and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Horse Thief River, a tributary of the Columbia River in British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
