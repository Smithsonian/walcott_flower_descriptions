PINEBARREN GENTIAN
Gentiana porphyrio Gmelin
Pinebarren gentian is a graceful and attractive plant. Its deep blue corolla lobes, with peculiar fringes between them, and the curious yellow markings on the inside, make a pleasing color combination seldom seen in flowers. It frequents moist pine barrens, teaching a foot or more in height, and although the flowers grow singly on the branches, a number of stems usually arise from each root, so that the clumps are very showy.
This gentian blooms from late August into October, and can be cultivated if given the moist, acid, peaty soil in which it thrives in the wild state. It occurs in the Coastal Plain from Florida to southern New Jersey.
The specimen sketched was found neat Wilmington, North Carolina.
