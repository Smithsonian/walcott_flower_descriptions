DRUMMOND PITCHERPLANT
Sarracenia drummondii Croom
The thrill of finding a pitcherplant in bloom is a rare experience, for the petals of these plants are short lived. The umbrella left behind is a curious object, but it lacks the distinctive beauty of the perfect flower, with its brilliant petals. Many insects are attracted to the treacherous pitchers and are lured to their death. Of all our wild flowers, pitcherplants are the most fascinating from the standpoint of their relations to insects, excepting only the orchids. They yield readily to cultivation in a cool greenhouse, when given the proper acid soil, and abundant moisture about their roots, approximating natural conditions. This may be accomplished by the use of a double pot, with peat moss in the interspace.
Drummond Pitcherplant is one of the largest of the several species of the genus, its pitchers reaching a height of three or even four feet. It is native in a rather restricted area along the Gulf Coast, from southwestern Georgia and western Florida to southern Mississippi.
The plant painted was brought into bloom in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington.
