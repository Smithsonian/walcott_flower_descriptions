ALPINE FORGET-ME-NOT
Myosotis alpestris Schmidt
Alpine forget-me-not has lovely blue, slightly scented flowers, densely clustered, with deep yellow centers. It prefers moist alpine slopes near timberline, and here it is found in perfection, coming into flower throughout the summer as the snow recedes. Like many alpine plants, it has shorter stems when it grows at higher elevations on the mountain sides, and there it may properly be described as a cluster of blue flowers surrounded by a rosette of green hairy leaves.
The forget-me-nots belong to the Borage Family. This one has a comparatively narrow range in North America, occurring from Colorado to Alberta and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
In the region near Baker Lake, ten miles from Lake Louise, Alberta, where these flowers were gathered, it grows in perfection at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
