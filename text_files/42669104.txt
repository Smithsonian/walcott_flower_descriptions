INDIANPIPE
Monotropa uniflora Linnaeus
The weird flowers of the Indianpipe develop in warm midsummer weather after rains. The flowers rise above the forest floor when most plants are past their bloom. The plants subsist upon decaying vegetable matter, having a mat of rootlets under the dead leaves. They have specialized away from the habits of ordinary plants, having lost their chlorophyl, and are ghostly white, or sometimes pale pink, with leaves that are mere scales. As the seeds mature, the flowers turn upward and blacken.
This plant is very widely distributed, being found practically throughout the North American continent north of Mexico, and also in Japan and the Himalayas.
On Mount Desert Island, Maine, where this specimen was gathered, Indianpipe grew in many localities.
