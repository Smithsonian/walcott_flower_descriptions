TUFTED SAXIFRAGE
Saxtfraga caespitosa Linnaeus
Tufted saxifrage grows among disintegrating rocks, usually where moisture is seeping through from the slopes above. One of its peculiarities is the tuft of green leaves at the base of each of the dainty flower stems, which are usually arranged in a graceful way. This species is very variable in size, and the most reduced alpine form is shown in the illustration.
Tufted saxifrage ranges through Canada to Greenland and westward to Alaska. It is found also in northern Asia and Europe.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained on the mountain slopes above the head waters of Johnson Creek, twenty miles by trail northeast of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
