GOLDENSTAR
Chrysogonum virginianum Linnaeus
Goldenstar is a showy and handsome plant of moist or dry woodlands. What appear to be its flowers are heads made up of numerous tiny tubular flowers, each of the five outer ones having its corolla transformed into a golden ray. The first flower heads bloom in spring, but the plant often continues to produce new blossoms from its lengthening stems until midsummer. The early-flowering plants, with their compact tufts of hairy leaves, are much more beautiful than the sprawling and weather-beaten plants of summer. Goldenstar is the only representative of its genus. It is seldom a common plant, but it is particularly abundant in the neighborhood of Washington, District of Columbia, where the specimen sketched was collected.
Goldenstar ranges from Florida and Alabama northward to southern Pennsylvania.
