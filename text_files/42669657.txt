WOOLLY AGOSERIS
Agoseris villosa Rydberg
When we were climbing the slopes of Survey Peak, which rises from the right bank of Glacier Lake, this showy plant was very prominent at an altitude of 7,500 feet. Our camp was pitched in the timber a quarter of a mile from the outlet of the lake, and there was some distance to be covered over a rough trail, among the willows, alders, and other thick, bushy vegetation, before the grassy slopes and bare rocks were reached. Here the sturdy stems of woolly agoseris stew from the rosettes of pale leaves, and the golden flowers showed to perfection against the soft gray background of the mountain side. The woody underground stems bore witness to many years of retarded growth resulting from short growing seasons, and from alpine environment. The plant is a member of the Chicory Family, and is related to the dandelion, which it somewhat resembles in general appearance.
Glacier Lake is reached by trail, and is about forty-eight miles northeast of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, Canada. _
Woolly agoseris ranges from Utah to Alberta and British Columbia.
