CHICKASAW PLUM
Prunus angustifolia Marshall
The Chickasaw plum is one of the first woody plants to bloom in the spring. It is really a small tree, in favorable situations growing to a height of twenty-five feet, with a trunk eight inches in diameter. It is very feathery and attractive when in bloom, though the petals soon fall. The fruit is bright red, rarely yellow, and is appreciated by wild birds. The Indians used it as food, and it can be made into jellies and jams of fine flavor.
This plum extends from Florida to southern New Jersey, and westward to Arkansas and Texas.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
