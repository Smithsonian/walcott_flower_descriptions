CALIFORNIA PITCHERPLANT
Chrysamphora californica (Torrey) Greene
California pitcherplant is the only member of the Pitcherplant Family growing west of the Mississippi Valley. It is quite as curious a plant as its eastern relatives, the Sarracenias. The pitcher, often two feet tall, has leafy appendages growing from its mouth, the whole suggesting the head of a cobra. These appendages are somewhat trough-like, and insects traveling along them to collect the nectar secreted there are unsuspectingly led to the brink of the hollow leaves. Many of these fall in and are digested, contributing to the nourishment of the plant. The flower presents an almost equally strange appearance.
The plants grow in abundance in their favorite localities, the bogs of northern California, where this specimen was obtained, and adjacent Oregon.
