VENUS FLYTRAP
Dionaea muscipula Ellis
Venus flytrap is one of the most interesting and remarkable plants in the United States. The restricted region on the Atlantic coast in which it grows has been visited by many scientists bent upon forming a personal acquaintance with the plant in its native haunts. The white flower is inconspicuous. It is the leaves, which form a cluster at the base of the flower stems, that are so unusual. The leaves are produced at the base of the flower stalk, and consist of a flat stalk and a blade composed of two sides, like the leaves of a book. These are hinged to the midrib, and fringed on the outer edges with tiny spikes. On their concave faces, near the center, three or more tiny hair triggers are found. When these are touched, even lightly, the hinges close, and the insect visitor is clasped between the folded blades, while the spikes interlace firmly. No struggling insect can escape; it is so tightly held that the outline of its body can be seen through the leaf tissue. The leaf secretes a digestive substance, through whose agency the soft parts of the insect are absorbed by the cells. When this digestion is complete the leaf opens and releases the hard indigestible parts. Charles Darwin tells us that this is “the most wonderful plant in the world.”
Venus flytrap has a narrow range, occurring only on the coast of North and South Carolina, especially in the vicinity of Wilmington, North Carolina.
The sketch was made from a specimen grown in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, District of Columbia.
