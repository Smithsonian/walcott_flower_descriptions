SMALL PYROLA
Pyrola minor Linnaeus
The small pyrola delights in wet places. We find it flourishing in bogs or on oozing stream banks, usually in densely shaded situations. Flowering in midsummer, its rosy pink saucers lend a touch of color to its otherwise dull surroundings. The flowers vary greatly in depth of color, and occasionally they are white. They are smaller and fewer than those of the bog pytola, which is a species more generally distributed and locally more abundant.
The small pytola has a wide range in the colder parts of North America, extending from Massachusetts to Colorado and California, and northward to the Arctic regions. It grows also in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the valley of the Pipestone River, about ten miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
