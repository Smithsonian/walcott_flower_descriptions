CAROLINA MAPLE
Acer carolinianum Walter
Carolina maple is closely related to the red maple, but it is often a smaller tree. The bark is smooth and gray and the wood light brown in color. The small, red flowers appear with the first days of spring, but the tree is at its best when the fruit develops, and the branches are covered with crimson “keys” which contrast strikingly with the bare branches of other nearby trees. Like its relative, the red maple, it prefers wet or moist soil, and often abounds in coastal swamps.
Carolina maple is distributed from Florida to Texas and northward to Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and has been reported also from Massachusetts.
The specimen sketched was obtained at Beaufort, South Carolina.
