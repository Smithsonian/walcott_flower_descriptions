ALPINE FERNLEAF
Pedicularis contorta Bentham
Alpine fernleaf is locally plentiful in the Canadian Rockies, but it seems particular in the choice of a situation where favorable conditions combine to give it both soil and exposure to its liking. It is often found on loose, steep soils above timber line. It grows in clumps, several flowering stems frequently a foot tall being produced from a central root. The leaves may be green or red, and the flowers either pure white or delicately shaded.
Alpine fernleaf occurs in the high mountains of Montana and California, extending northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched grew on the slope of Mount St. Piran near Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
