MOUNTAIN JUNIPER
Juniperus sibirica Burgsdorf
Mountain juniper frequents dry, stony places either among other shrubs of on open mountain slopes, where it forms circular patches often ten feet in diameter, but seldom more than eighteen inches tall. Its many stiff branches and prickly leaves are so offensive that ponies, as well as people, avoid crossing the patches. By midsummer the bushes are loaded with blue-gray berry-like cones which, when winter comes, are eaten by wild birds. The berries of some of the other species of juniper were used by the Indians, who are them either raw or dried, or ground into meal and prepared as mush or cakes. Cakes made from berries of alligator juniper, an Arizona species, are said to be easily digested and palatable to European people.
Mountain juniper ranges from Massachusetts, New York, and Michigan north to Labrador and central Canada, and in the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to California and northward to Alaska. It occurs also in Siberia.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the Saskatchewan River Valley, British Columbia, fifty miles north of Lake Louise Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
