RED WILLOWWEED
Epilobium latifolium Linnaeus
Red willowweed is a superb member of the Evening-primrose Family that prefers gravelly stream bottoms, especially those overflowed by the water from melting glaciers, and also often borders alpine brooks. The large petals are inserted at the top of the long slender pods, which, when ripe, split lengthwise, freeing the plumed seeds which are blown by the wind far from the parent plant. When the plants are in bloom, they make a gorgeous sight, often covering many acres with their lovely color.
This plant has a wide range from Greenland to Quebec, South Dakota, Colorado, Washington, and Alaska. It occurs also in Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
