PINK MOUNTAINHEATHER
Phyllodoce empetriformis (Smith) Don
The mountainheathers of the Canadian Rockies are an inspiration and a delight to those who climb to the higher places. They are found near tree line and on the bare slopes just above it, and cover the mountain sides with their deep green foliage. In blossom time they make a wonderful carpet of color-pink, red, and white. Among them all, the pink mountainheather is in many respects the most beautiful.
On Burgess Pass, seven miles by trail from Field, British Columbia, where this specimen was gathered at an altitude of 7,000 feet, the coloring was almost like that of an India shawl. The seed-pods are deep red and covered with golden dots of resin. Pink mountainheather ranges from California to Colorado and northward to Alaska.
