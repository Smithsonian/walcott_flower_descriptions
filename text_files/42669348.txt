WHITEBARK PINE
Pinus albicaulis Engelmann
Whitebark pine, if growing in a favorable location, is somewhat different in its habit of growth from most other pine trees. The branches are flexible and often almost erect, the purple cones being borne near their ends. The trunk is frequently two to four feet in diameter, but the height of the tree is only twenty to thirty feet. This pine is seldom found below 5,000 feet, and at timberline it grows as a low and often creeping shrub. When in bloom the dainty pink staminate flowers are very lovely. They shed their pollen freely. On wind-swept summits this tree takes on weatherbeaten and fantastic forms.
Whitebark pine ranges from Wyoming to California and north to Alberta and British Columbia.
The branch sketched came from a tree which grew on the side of the Yoho Valley, ten miles from Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
