PALE PINESAP
Hypopitys americana (De Candolle) Small
Pale pinesap is a woodland plant, preferring moist situations. It blooms in late summer. The succulent stems are provided with scales in place of leaves, and the whole plant is devoid of green coloration. It is not a parasite like ghostpipe, but is saprophytic, that is, it obtains its nourishment from decomposing vegetable matter, after the fashion of the mushrooms. In aspect it is similar to its close relative, the red pinesap, but lacks the bright coloring of that species. It belongs to the Indian Pipe Family, degenerate relatives of the heaths. One of more species of pinesap occur in woods from Florida to Newfoundland and Ontario. A very similar plant is found in Europe, but the relationships of the several species have not been finally determined.
The specimen sketched was found near Washington, District of Columbia.
