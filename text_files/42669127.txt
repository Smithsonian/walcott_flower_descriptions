SIDEBELLS PYROLA
Pyrola secunda Linnaeus
Sidebells pyrola—its name often contracted to sidebells—is a dainty plant, with small, leathery leaves close to the ground. It loves moist shady places. The tiny bell-shaped flowers hang from one side of the flower stem, and by this characteristic the species is easily distinguished from the other pyrolas. It seems easily satisfied with respect to habitat, for we find it growing plentifully in widely different situations, although always in rather acid soil.
This diminutive relative of the heaths has a wide range, occurring from Virginia to California and Mexico, and northward to Alaska and Labrador. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made at Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, where the specimen grew at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
