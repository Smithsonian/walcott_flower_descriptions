TARFLOWER
Befaria racemosa Ventenat
While traveling through the South in June, whether by rail or automobile, one finds the green fringe of low shrubbery by the roadsides dotted here and there with the pink starlike blossoms of the tarflower. These shrubs rarely occur in dense vegetation, but usually in such places as will permit them to raise their flowery heads above the grass, weeds, and low shrubbery, to beckon the insect sponsors necessary for their cross pollination.
The species ranges from southern Florida to southeastern Georgia.
The specimen here figured came from a woodland margin along the tracks of the Florida East Coast Railroad near Jacksonville, Florida.
