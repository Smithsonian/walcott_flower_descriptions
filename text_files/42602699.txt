LILY TWAYBLADE
Liparis liliifolia (Linnaeus) Richard
This little orchid is inconspicuous where it grows, on account of its protective coloring, which blends so perfectly with its surroundings, though a fascinating plant when examined closely. It blooms in May and has two rich green leaves that clasp the flower stem and grow from a solid perennial bulb. It is the easiest to cultivate of all our native orchids, not being particular as to the reaction of the soil, although it prefers an abundance of humus.
The lily twayblade extends from Missouri to Georgia and northward, and since the ice of the glacial period retreated has succeeded in migrating as far north as Minnesota and Maine.
The specimen sketched grew on High Island in the Potomac River neat Washington, District of Columbia.
