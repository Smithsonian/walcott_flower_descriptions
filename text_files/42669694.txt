CUCUMBERTREE
Magnolia acuminata Linnaeus
The cucumbertree is a handsome inhabitant of the eastern forests. Under favorable conditions it attains a height of ninety feet with a proportionately broad crown. The greenish-yellow flowers, in spite of their large size, are not so conspicuous as those of some other magnolias, for their color blends with that of the leaves. The cylindrical fruit, when ripe, is rose-colored, but before maturity it is green, and bears some resemblance to a small cucumber. The wood is soft and yellowish brown.
This species has a wider range than most of the magnolias, extending from Georgia to Mississippi and Missouri and northward to New York and Ontario.
The specimen sketched was taken from a beautiful tree growing in front of the buildings of the Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.
