NORTHERN LADYSLIPPER
Cypripedium passerinum Richardson
We had made numerous visits to the Canadian Rockies without having seen this beautiful ladyslipper, but one midsummer day, after fording a rushing mountain torrent, we came upon it suddenly. It was crowded among other plants, and seemed to prefer a moist situation with some sunshine. Elsewhere in the mountains we have since found it on the shores of lakes or streams, but usually in sheltered situations. In some places rich leafmold encouraged more vigorous growth, and the plants were in clumps eighteen inches in height, with a profusion of the modest slipper-shaped flowers. The old seed pods of the previous season indicated nature’s prodigality in providing abundant seeds.
This orchid is distributed from Ontario to Alberta and British Columbia and northward to Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew at Healy Creek, near Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,700 feet.
