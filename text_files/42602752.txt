BALSAMROOT
Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nuttall
Wherever it is found, balsamroot is a striking plant. The arrowshaped leaves, blue-green on the upper surface and white on the under side, are borne on stalks five or six inches long, above which the handsome yellow flowers are poised on still longer stems. When in bloom these plants brighten whole mountain sides with gold. The plant prefers moist situations on partially shaded, steep slopes, but in the lower valleys it frequents the borders of swampy land, among coarse grass and alder and willow bushes. The horses love to feed upon it, and will never pass a fine clump in perfection of leaf and bloom, unless urged on. The large fleshy roots are eaten by the Indians, and in Utah they are commonly called Mormon biscuit, because of their use by the early immigrants in times of scarcity.
Balsamroot is distributed from Colorado and California to British Columbia and South Dakota.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
