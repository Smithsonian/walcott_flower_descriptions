ALPINE FIR
Abies lasiocarpa (Hooker) Nuttall
The alpine fir, commonly called balsam fir in the mountains, is the tree best known to those who follow the trail in the Canadian Rockies, for it is the substitute par excellence for a soft hair mattress, if the bed is properly made, and no sleep is more restful than that obtained on such an aromatic couch of “Rocky Mountain feathers”. From the numerous blisters in the bark a thick juice may be collected which makes an effective dressing for cuts and bruises. The Canada balsam used by microscopists in mounting specimens is obtained from a related species, the balsam fir. By some of the Indian tribes the fir tree was called “cho-koh-tung”, meaning blisters. The wood is soft and coarse-grained and, though it grows rather rapidly, is not of much value commercially. In the lower valleys of the Canadian Rockies the tree attains to some size, and at timber line holds the final outposts with the Lyall latches, often affording a striking exhibit of nature’s adaptation to adverse conditions of soil, temperature, and wind.
This fir has a wide range. It survived the glacial period in the southern Rocky Mountains, in Northern Arizona and New Mexico, and since the ice retreated has migrated northward along the coast ranges to the Olympic Mountains of Washington, thence into Alaska, and through the eastern Rockies into Alberta, Canada.
The specimen sketched was obtained north of Bow Pass, one day s tide from the Saskatchewan River, at the foot of Pyramid Peak, at 6,000 feet elevation.
