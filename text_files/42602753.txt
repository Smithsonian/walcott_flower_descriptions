SILVERBERRY
Elaeagnus commutata Bernhardi
After crossing the plains and coming into the foothill country, the traveler will observe many thickets of silvery-gray shrubs. In June, on approaching these clumps he is greeted by the peculiar sweet scent of the greenish funnel-shaped bells, with yellow petals, that hang from the under sides of the branches. The leaves, when examined under a lens, are seen to be covered with silvery scales. Similar scales covering the fruit have given the plant the name silverberry. It is nearly related to the buffaloberry, and often grows with it. Both are members of the group of plants known as the Oleaster Family, which is considered by botanists to belong in the same order as the loosestrifes and evening primroses.
Silverberry is found from Quebec to Minnesota and from Utah to the Yukon.
The specimen sketched was collected near Ghost River, twenty-five miles northeast of Banff, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
