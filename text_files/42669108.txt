AMERICAN HOLLY
Ilex opaca Aiton
The brilliant red berries and spiny evergreen leaves of American holly carry with them all the Old World associations, even though our species is different from that of Europe. The inconspicuous flowers are of a greenish color, and the pistillate and staminate flowers usually occur on separate trees. American holly is most abundant in moist woods on rather acid soils. It sometimes teaches a height of fifty feet, with a trunk three and a half feet in diameter, but is of slow growth. The wood is white, close-grained, and hard; the bark greenish gray, with white markings. The great demand for holly at Christmas stimulates cutting for commercial purposes, and is denuding the forests of this beautiful evergreen. To save it from extermination, substitutes must be used whenever possible.
American holly is found from Florida to Texas and Missouri, and northward to Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.
The sketch was made from a specimen obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.
