REDBUD
Cercis canadensis Linnaeus
When the dogwood buds are bursting into bloom in early spring, a companion tree, the redbud, is seen throughout our southern woods, its knotted branches covered with clusters of purplish-pink, pea-shaped flowers. In favorable localities the tree attains a height of forty or fifty feet, though usually much smaller. The leaves, which develop after the flowers, are heart-shaped-quite unlike those of most legumes-and are a glossy green, turning to yellow in autumn. The flowers are well supplied with nectar, and are most attractive to bees, who visit them in large numbers. In some regions the redbud is known as Judas-tree, a name properly applied to the Old World species, Cercis siliquastrum.
The tree has a wide range, from Texas to Florida and northward. Though best developed in the South, it has been able to migrate north as far as Minnesota and northern New Jersey, and even a short distance into southern Ontario.
The specimen drawn was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
