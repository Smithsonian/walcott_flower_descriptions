ALPINE MONKEYFLOWER
Mimulus caespitosus Greene
The low growth of alpine monkeyflower coupled with the unusually large blossoms makes this species easy to recognize. It loves wet places by the edges of cold brooks, although it does not grow actually in the water. Often it is the first flower to gain a foothold in the beds of glacial moraines, uncovered by the recent recession of the ice. The masses of golden yellow flowers were conspicuous near the forefoot of the Illecillewaet Glacier, near Glacier, British Columbia. The alpine monkeyflower belongs to the Figwort Family and ranges from Idaho to California and northward to British Columbia.
The flowers painted were gathered in the Asulkan Valley near Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
