YELLOW WILLOW-WEED
Epilobium lutem Putsh
The lush growth of yellow willow-weed attracts attention to the plant, as its greenish-yellow funnel-shaped flowers are inconspicuous. It loves the moist borders of streams, or other wet places. The long seed pods are characteristic of the Epilobiums, a wellknown genus of the Evening-primrose Family. This species has a narrow range, being found from Washington State, and British Columbia to Alaska.
Yellow willow-weed grows plentifully in the Selkirk Mountains near Glacier House, at Glacier, British Columbia, where this specimen was gathered at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
