PRAIRIE ASTER
Aster campestris Nuttall
In one of our saddle journeys in the Columbia River Valley in British Columbia, the waning season for flowers brought to our notice this beautiful aster. It seemed to ignore the dry soil conditions, and expanded its bright purple flowers in many exposed situations where other plants had gone to seed. The slender stems are very brittle; the narrow leaves are usually entire, though sometimes toothed.
The prairie aster ranges along the Rocky Mountains from Colorado to Oregon and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched grew near Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
