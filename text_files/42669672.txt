BEAUTYBERRY
Callicarpa americana Linnaeus
Beautyberry is one of the common plants of the Southern States, growing in moist thickets or in dry, sandy places. It is a bushy shrub, sometimes as much as six feet tall. The small, bluish or pinkish flowers, appearing in spring in dense clusters in the axils of the leaves, are rather inconspicuous. In autumn they are followed by bunches of juicy fruits of an unusual tint, making a large bush a magnificent sight. The fruits persist well through the winter, unless eaten by birds. This plant is a member of the Verbena Family, and is sometimes called French mulberry, apparently because of a remote resemblance of the fruit clusters to mulberries.
This native species is much more showy than the related Asiatic species, but is rarely cultivated. It occurs from Florida northward to Virginia and westward to Texas and Missouri.
