PARROT PITCHERPLANT
Sarracenia psittacina Michaux
Parrot pitcherplant is a beautiful member of the bizarre group to which it belongs. The Pitcherplant Family consists of only three genera and about ten species, all American. The true pitcherplants are all natives of the eastern United States, but one of their relatives grows in the mountains of California, and the other still farther away, in the mountains of Guiana. Our pitcherplants inhabit peat bogs, and they may be grown easily in the hot-house in a mixture of peat and sand. The pot should be placed inside a larger one, and the space between should be stuffed with peat moss, thus imitating the natural conditions of soil and moisture.
The parrot pitcherplant is one of the many interesting plants which are found on our southeastern Coastal Plain. It ranges from Florida to Georgia and Alabama.
The specimen sketched was grown in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington.
