CRESTED IRIS
Iris cristata Aiton
The crested iris is dwarf in habit and its lance-shaped leaves of bright green taper at each end. The flowers, which appear in May, seem out of proportion to the size of the plant. Their broad outer divisions or petals have yellow, raised flutings along the center, which give rise to the name. This lovely plant yields easily to cultivation in a wild garden, being relatively indifferent as to soil reaction, but requiring plenty of humus and enough rocks to insure good drainage.
The crested iris may be found from Georgia to Maryland and west to Missouri and southern Indiana.
This specimen was sketched at Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.
