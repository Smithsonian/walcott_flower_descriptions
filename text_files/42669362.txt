YELLOW PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon confertus Douglas
Yellow pentstemon is a graceful member of the Figwort Family. In congenial surroundings it is very plentiful, although inconspicuous on account of the pale coloring of its flowers, which are grouped in several whorls along the stem. Altitude affects the plant greatly; in the lower valleys it may grow to a height of two feet, but at a high elevation the stem is only a few inches tall. Yellow flowers are rare among the pentstemons, which are represented in the Rocky Mountains by a number of species, most of them with white or purple blossoms.
This pentstemon extends from Wyoming to California, and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The plant sketched grew in the valley of Cataract Creek near Hector, British Columbia, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
