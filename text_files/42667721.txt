PINXTERBLOOM
Azalea nudiflora Linnaeus
In early spring, the bare stems of the pinxterbloom, or wild azalea with their clusters of curved red buds, are conspicuous in the woods or along the banks of the brimful streams. As the flowers open, exhaling their peculiar faint perfume, they are visited by bumble bees and moths. The leaves begin to open about the same time as the flowers, but they do not expand fully until the blooming period has passed.
Easily yielding to cultivation, if the soil is acid, either sunny or shady places may be utilized to grow the plants. They will flourish also in either dry or swampy situations, growing to a height of six feet in suitable soil.
This species of pinxterbloom ranges from North Carolina northward, and since the ice sheets of the glacial period retreated, it has pushed a short distance into the glaciated territory, to a line extending from Illinois through central New York to Massachusetts. A closely related species occurs still farther north.
The specimen sketched was collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
