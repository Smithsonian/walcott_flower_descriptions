GRASSLEAF AGOSERIS
Agoseris graminifolia Greene
Grassleaf agoseris, although occurring in many places in the Canadian Rockies, is not often seen by travelers, for it usually grows amid a tangle of grass and other plants, and opens its flowers only in full sunlight. It has graceful leaves, and the fluffy seed heads, like those of dandelion, are more showy than the flowers. Some of the widely windblown seeds find suitable places for germination. Like other members of the Chicory Family, to which this plant belongs, its leaves and stems have a milky juice.
Grassleaf agoseris ranges from Arizona northward to the Canadian Rockies of Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was found by the shote of Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 5,700 feet.
