PALE STRAWBERRY
Fragaria glauca (Watson) Rydberg
Wild strawberries grow almost every where in the Canadian Rockies. Their large white flowers with yellow centers and the bright red fruits which follow them are known to all campers. Later in the season the leaves turn red. The plants propagate by runners, produced after the fruiting season. A tea made from the leaves is most efficacious in intestinal complaints, and its properties were known to the Indians, who often chewed the leaves for the same purpose. Wild strawberries are found throughout most of the United States and Canada, and also extend far southward along the mountains of Mexico. Long ago they were brought into cultivation, and they have been improved greatly, at least in size, by horticulturists.
This member of the Rose Family ranges from Nevada, New Mexico, and South Dakota to British Columbia.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected in the valley of Baker Creek, thirty miles by trail from Lake Louise, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
