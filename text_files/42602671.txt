PURPLE SAXIFRAGE
Saxifraga oppositifolia Linnaeus
The purple saxifrage ts truly an alpine plant. In the Canadian Rockies it is found above tree line near the melting snows on southern slopes, where it comes quickly into bloom in the long days of early summer, and as quickly is past, leaving the matted rosettes of tiny, bright green leaves, dotted with dull red seed capsules, to reward our search, if, perchance, we are a few days too late to find it in bloom. It delights in disintegrated limestone, often growing in cracks between the rocks. Though plentiful in its chosen situation, it is not often seen by visitors, who must make a hard climb to reach its haunts. In Alaska and near the Arctic Circle it finds the most favorable conditions for perfect development, growing into large mats.
The purple saxifrage is typical of Arctic regions throughout the world, and no doubt survived the glacial period close to the margins of the great ice sheets. When these withdrew, it followed back on the bare rock surfaces. It is now found occasionally in the northern United States, from Wyoming to Vermont, and more abundantly northward.
The specimen sketched grew on the slopes of Fossil Mountain neat Baker Lake, seven miles northeast of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.
