SLIM LARKSPUR
Delphinium depauperatum Nuttall
The brilliant color of slim larkspurs in mountain meadows filled us with delight, and when they were in company with Alberta paintbrush, but-forget-me-not, and heliotrope valerian, all in full bloom, we were able to appreciate the full beauty of nature's garden. In some places slim larkspur occurred in pure stands so that the meadows were blue with them. They are poisonous to cattle, which eat the young shoots in early spring, and the districts where they grow cannot be used for pasture. The name Delphinium was given to this genus of plants from a fancied resemblance of the flower to a dolphin. The larkspurs belong to the Buttercup Family.
Slim larkspur ranges from Montana to California and Oregon and northward to Alberta.
The plants sketched were obtained near Wild Flower Camp, twenty-five miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
