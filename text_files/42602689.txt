QUAKERLADIES
Houstonia caerulea Linnaeus
Quakerladies, sometimes called bluets and innocence, are among our earliest spring flowers, and delight flower lovers by their dainty growth and faint, sweet odor. Occurring plentifully in moist meadows and wayside places, they sometimes completely carpet the ground. They may be gathered freely, without fear of extermination. They continue blooming into early summer, and frequently put forth a second bloom in late fall. No wildflower garden would be complete without them, a rather sterile and acid soil and a fair amount of sunshine being all that they ask.
Linnaeus named this plant in honor of Dr. William Houston, a young English botanist, who died in South America after an exhausting collecting trip around the Gulf of Mexico in 1733.
Quakerladies are widely distributed, being found from Georgia and Alabama northward to eastern Canada and Michigan. 
The plant sketched grew at Washington, District of Columbia.
