BIRDSFOOT VIOLET
Viola pedata Linnaeus
The birdsfoot violet is one of the most beautiful members of the Violet Family. The velvety purple color of the two upper petals, combined with the pale blue-violet shade of the three lower ones, contrasted with the bright orange anthers nestling in the center, immediately attracts the attention of all who love wild flowers. Bumblebees, also yellow butterflies, visit the flowers and partake of the sweets prepared for their enjoyment. When soil and exposure are favorable, the ground is purple with the lovely blossoms, the absence of scent being the only flaw in their perfection.
This plant prefers a dry situation where the soil is poor, sterile, and acid, and should not be transferred to a wildflower garden unless satisfied in this respect, for in ordinary rich loam it will promptly die. It will thrive best if planted in coarse gravel richly charged with decaying wood and so rendered thoroughly acid. The small bulblike rootstock is so poorly anchored in the soil and so easily lifted from its moorings, that frequently it comes up when one attempts to pick the flowers. Great care should therefore be taken in gathering them.
This violet is found from Louisiana to Florida, Minnesota, and Massachusetts, the dark purple variety being much more frequent in the southern portion of the range.
The specimen sketched was obtained neat Washington, District of Columbia.
