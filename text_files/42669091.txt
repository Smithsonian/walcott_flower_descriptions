CUT TOOTHWORT
Dentaria laciniata Muhlenberg
Cut toothwort is found in spring growing plentifully in rich, moist woods, at about the same time as bloodroot and hepatica. The name toothwort is given because of the protuberances on the rootstocks of some of the species of Dentaria. These rootstocks have a spicy flavor similar to watercress, and are enjoyed by country children, who know one of the species as “crinkleroot” and dig its rootstocks to eat with their school lunches. The pale pink or white flowers of cut toothwort are rather attractive, but the plant withers quickly when gathered, and does not easily revive.
This member of the Mustard Family is found from Florida to Louisiana and Kansas, and northward to Quebec and Minnesota.
The sketch was made from flowers gathered in Washington, District of Columbia.
