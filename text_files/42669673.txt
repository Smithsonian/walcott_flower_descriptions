FIELD VIOLET
Viola rafinesquii Greene
The field violet is one of the daintiest members of the Violet Family. It prefers the drier fields and open woods, and because it so frequently is found growing in the grass, and has such a pale color, it is easily overlooked. Field violet is a winter annual, and growing day by day as the weather permits, it is one of the earliest violets to bloom in spring. It soon withers when the hot summer sun strikes it. It is more closely related to some of the European violets than to other American species, as shown by the large stipules at the base of the leaves. When freshly pulled the roots have the odor and taste of wintergreen.
Field violet extends from Georgia to Texas, and northward to New York and Michigan.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the National Zoological Park at Washington, District of Columbia.
