ALPINE POINTVETCH
Oxytropis podocarpa Gray
Alpine pointvetch is adorned, a little later in the season, with inflated pods. As the slender stems are unable to beat their weight, the pods lie on the ground, and sometimes, if the plant is especially sturdy, make a circle of fruit around the gray silky leaves. The tiny peas soon ripen, and finding lodgment in some cranny among the stones and rocks, produce new plants.
We find this member of the Pea Family in Labrador, and in the west from Colorado and Idaho northward to British Columbia and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was collected near Bow Lake, twenty-five miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,800 feet.
