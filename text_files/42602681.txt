PITCHERPLANT
Sarracenia purpurea Linnaeus
The pitcherplant is found in peat bogs, where the acid soil provides ideal conditions for its successful growth. The pitcher-shaped leaves grow from a central crown, and are partially filled with water and a digestive substance. The inner surfaces of the leaves are lined with bristles which project downward, and these prevent many small insects that slide into the water from escaping. Thus they are trapped, drowned, and digested. These dead insects are also used as food by the larvae of several species of sarcophagous flies, which are instrumental in the cross-pollination of the flower, and are always found where the pitcherplant grows.
The flowers are borne on a stem from six inches to two feet tall a vigorous plant often yielding seven or eight blossoms.
A cool greenhouse is necessary for successful indoor cultivation. It is well to place the plant in a flower pot filled with acid soil made from a mixture of peat and sand, and to set this pot inside another of two inches greater diameter, the space between the two being filled with sphagnum moss, which should be kept moist.
The pitcherplant is one of the plants that was pushed southward by the ice cap during glacial times. Since the great ice sheet retreated it has been gradually moving northward, and now ranges from Florida to Kentucky and lowa, and north to Labrador and Manitoba.
The specimen sketched was collected in eastern Maryland.
