SWEETBAY
Magnolia virginiana Linnaeus
Sweetbay is found in swampy woods or deep swamps where it is usually a shrub, although sometimes attaining the size of a tree. The leathery leaves are silvery beneath, and their upper surface is a rich dark green. The solitary flowers are borne at the tips of the branches, where the creamy petals contrast pleasingly with the deeply colored foliage. Their delicious and pervasive odor is their greatest attraction. Long after the flowers have passed they are succeeded by a coneshaped fruit in which, when fully ripe, the separate parts split open, and the seeds with their bright red fleshy covering dangle by slender threads. When the thread finally breaks, the seeds are blown by the wind to substantial distances. While beavers were abundant they felled the trunks of these trees for building their dams, and they were so fond of the bark that it was employed frequently to bait beaver traps. Sweetbay is often called beaver tree.
This striking member of the Magnolia Family is found around the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Texas and Arkansas, and northward along the Atlantic coastal plain to Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. It always grows in the most acid of soils, and thrives in cultivation only if planted in such soils.
It grows plentifully in the neighborhood of Washington, District of Columbia, where this specimen was found.
