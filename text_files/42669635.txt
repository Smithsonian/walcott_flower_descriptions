WESTERN BLUEBELLS
Mertensia paniculata (Aiton) Don
We have seen bluebells but rarely in our Western travels. Unlike its cousin, the Virginia bluebells, this plant is hairy, and the smaller, less numerous flowers are much deeper in color. The plant inhabits moist woodlands, where it often forms large clumps. Western bluebells belongs to the Borage Family, and is a relative of forget-me-not and heliotrope.
This species of bluebells ranges from Iowa to Washington and Alaska, and extends eastward to Lake Superior and Hudson Bay.
The specimen sketched was collected near Lake Minnewonka, eleven miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,000 feet.
