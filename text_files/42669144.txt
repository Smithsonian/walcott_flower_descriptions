BEARGRASS
Xerophyllum tenax (Pursh) Nuttall
Beargrass is a conspicuous plant when in bloom, the spikes of creamy flowers contrasting with the dark green foliage of the neighboring trees and plants. The numerous flowers seem almost too heavy even for the stout stems supporting them. On steep slopes, sterile plants often form a close sward, which is so slippery that it is difficult to traverse. The tender young flower shoots are eaten by bears, and are also cut down by ground squirrels for food. The Indians use the leaves in making fine baskets, and for this reason the plant is sometimes known as “basketgrass.” The genus contains only two other species, one of which, known as “turkeysbeard,” is found on the Atlantic coast.
Beargrass belongs to the Lily Family. It has a narrow range, occurring only from Montana and California to British Columbia. It is especially plentiful in Glacier National Park.
The specimen sketched was obtained in Mount Rainier National Park.
