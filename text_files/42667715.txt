PUSSY WILLOW
Salix discolor Muhlenberg
Pussy willows possess a certain fascination when we gather them with their tight winter buds, early in spring, in their wild haunts, and watch them expand in the warmer air of the house into fluffy catkins. Out of doors they attract many bees to the early feast of pollen spread for them. The catkins are of two kinds, borne on separate plants; those which bear only flowers with stamens, and the fertile ones which produce later in the season myriads of silk-appendaged seeds.
Pussy willow grows in swamps and on moist hillsides from Delaware to North Carolina and Missouri, and northward to Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Washington, District of Columbia.
