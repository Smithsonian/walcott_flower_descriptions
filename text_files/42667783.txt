DOUGLAS HONEYSUCKLE
Lonicera glaucescens Rydberg
The bright ted fruit of the Douglas honeysuckle ripens in September. At this season the leaves turn yellow, their veins being usually red. The juicy, inedible fruits are in clusters, each cluster surrounded by a leafy cup.
The range of this plant covers the central and northern portions of the United States, and southern Canada.
This sketch was made from a specimen found in September, in the upper Kootenay Valley near the motor road between the Columbia River Valley and Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 3,000 feet.
