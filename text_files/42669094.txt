BOWMANSROOT
Porteranthus trifoliatus (Linnaeus) Britton
The delicate flowers of bowmansroot grace the woodlands in June, when the graceful loose panicles of white blossoms, sometimes tinged with pink, are at their best. To the layman, the plant bears little resemblance to other members of the Rose Family, to which it belongs. The name Porteranthus was given in honor of Thomas Conrad Porter, professor of botany in Lafayette College. In many books the plant is named Gillenia trifoliata.
Bowmansroot ranges from Georgia to Missouri, and northward to New York, Ontario, and Michigan. The plant sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
