MEXICAN POPPY
Eschscholtzia mexicana Greene
Mexican poppy is a gay member of the Poppy Family, covering sandy desert mesas with sheets of lovely flowers. It is rather lower in growth than the California poppy. The finely cut gray-green leaves make an effective background for the flowers, which open fully in bright sunshine, but close at night and do not open in cloudy weather. The buds are enclosed by the sepals which form a tiny cap, which is pushed aside as the petals unfold. The plant is cultivated easily and is a great favorite with the amateur gardener.
Mexican poppy occurs in arid portions of Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and northern Mexico.
The sketch was made from specimens growing near Tucson, Arizona.
