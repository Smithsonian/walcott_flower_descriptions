RED MONKEYFLOWER
Diplacus puniceus Nuttall
Red monkeyflower is a bushy plant four to five feet tall, with bright green foliage, beautifully decorated with velvety red flowers. It is most attractive when found growing in the crevices of the sea cliffs on the coast, or the steep sides of the arroyos. Perhaps the flowers of some species of this genus, a typical member of the Figwort Family, may resemble monkey faces as implied in the common name but as far as this flower is concerned, the resemblance is remote.
Red monkeyflower is found only in California, and is especially abundant in the region about Torrey Pines, where the sketch was made.
