TASSEL COTTONGRASS
Eriophorum angustifolium Roth
We had passed many seasons on the trail without meeting specimens of the tassel cottongtass. This was not because it is rare, but because its heads are spoiled completely by wind, snow, or rain, and it is then easily passed unnoticed. But when in perfection, the plant is most attractive. The heads are supported on tall stems, with the dainty tassels pendent on slender threads from the cluster above them. We finally discovered it in great quantities in a grassy swamp.
Tassel cottongrass has a wide range, in regions of cold climate, occurring from Maine to Newfoundland, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, and Alaska. It also occurs in Europe and Asia.
The sketch was made from specimens found at Pipestone Pass, three days by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
