TALL LARKSPUR
Delphinium elongatum Rydberg
Tall larkspur is found in rich mountain valleys, where it loves to grow among the willow clumps that partially shade the soil about its roots. It is usually from two to four feet in height, and if free from other plants has a striking clump of basal leaves, above which rise the long spikes of rich purplish-blue flowers, swaying in the breezes. The power to fertilize themselves having been lost, cross-pollination is effected by bees and butterflies, whose tongues reach into the deep recesses of the flowers where the nectar is hidden. The name Delphinium was given by Linnaeus, from a fancied resemblance of the parts of the flower to a dolphin.
Tall larkspur has a narrow range, being found only from Colorado to Alberta.
The specimen drawn was collected on the Clearwater River, fifty miles north of Lake Louise Station, Alberta, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
