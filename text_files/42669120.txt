GRAY PHACELIA
Phacelia sericea (Graham) Gray
Gray phacelia grows under various conditions in the higher mountains. Some plants are quite low, others form stems a foot tall, springing from a bunch of silky gray-green leaves. The flowers are produced in elongated clusters. The deep purple color of the flowers contrasts with the bright yellow of the anthers, which stand out on filaments much longer than the corolla, giving a feathery appearance to the spikes. Numerous insects are attracted by the strong, disagreeable odor. Gray phacelia belongs to the Waterleaf Family, and ranges from Colorado and Nevada northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
The sketch was made from a specimen collected near Glacier, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
