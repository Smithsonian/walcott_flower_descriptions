FIREWEED
Epilobium angustifolium Linnaeus
The magenta hue of fireweed is often inharmonious with the colors of other flowers, but when seen alone in valleys or on mountain sides, tinting the landscape, it is very beautiful. The tall, graceful stems are decorated with many flowers, and these are followed by the cottony seeds which are blown everywhere by the passing winds. After forest fires, fireweed is the first plant to cover the burns, and its name was derived from this fact. Occasionally the flowers are white or very pale pink. Where the soil is especially rich, the plant may grow to a height of five or six feet. It belongs to the Eveningprimrose Family.
Fireweed has a wide range, occurring from North Carolina to Greenland, and westward to New Mexico, California, and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched came from the valley of the Clearwater River, thirty miles by trail north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
