SWEET PITCHERPLANT
Sarracenia rubra Walter
Sweet pitcherplant is a lovely member of its family, its flowers held aloft on delicate stems well above the “pitchers.” In addition to other interesting features, it has a delightful odor similar to that of wild grape blossoms. The leaves have the usual characteristics of pitcherplants, catching and digesting unwary insects that enter them. Of all the pitcherplants, this is, perhaps, the most desirable to cultivate because of its fragrance and its lasting qualities. It should be grown in a cool greenhouse.
Sweet pitcherplant is found from Georgia and Alabama to North Carolina, growing chiefly at moderate elevations.
The specimen sketched was brought into bloom by Dr. Frederick V. Coville in the greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture in Washington, District of Columbia.
