BEARBERRY
Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Linnaeus) Sprengel
When August comes, the green fruits of the bearberry, or kinnikinnick, begin to appear, and soon turn a bright red. Then the plant assumes a more interesting appearance, and if a sufficient amount of moisture is available the berries are numerous and well developed. Grouse and other birds are glad to add these berries to their scanty winter menu, even though they taste to us dry and insipid.
Bearberry, which belongs to the Heath Family, may be found from New Jersey to New Mexico and California, and northward to Labrador and Alaska.
The specimen sketched was collected near Banff, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 4,500 feet.
