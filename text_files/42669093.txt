HOODED PITCHERPLANT
Sarracenia minor Walter
Hooded pitcherplant has some distinctive features not shown by most other members of the family. The hood is beautifully arched, and tends to darken the interior cavity of the leaf. Contrasting with the opaque yellow-green of the surrounding leaf structure, the translucent patches near the summit of the hood are white, and act as windows, transmitting light to the upper part of the “pitchers.” Insects encouraged by the light to enter are often unable to find the way out, and exhausted by their endeavors to escape, drop to the bottom of the “pitcher,” where they die and are digested for the use of the plant.
This is the southernmost in range of all the pitcherplants, occurring in damp, acid meadows as far south as the middle of the Florida peninsula, and ranging northward through eastern Georgia, but barely entering Alabama and North Carolina.
The sketch was made from plants collected near Beaufort, South Carolina.
