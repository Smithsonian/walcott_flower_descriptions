PURPLE MOUNTAIN VIOLET
Viola adunca J. E. Smith
The purple mountain violet is a small plant of the higher altitudes, whose flowers are large in proportion to the size of the leaves. It nestles in the grass and other herbage as though to hide its lovely blossoms, and soon fades in the hot sunshine of early summer. The painting represents an unusual dwarfish form of this species, which at lower altitudes is a taller, longer-stemmed plant, especially when it grows in wet, shaded spots.
Viola adunca has a wide range, being found from New Hampshire and New Brunswick to the mountains of New Mexico and California, and north to Alaska.
The specimen sketched grew near the shores of Bow Lake, thirty miles north of Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
