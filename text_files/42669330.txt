MOSS FORGET-ME-NOT
Eritrichum elongatum (Rydberg) W.F. Wight
This member of the Borage Family, whose flowers look so much like a true forget-me-not, is one of the plants that have adapted themselves to severe alpine conditions. Growing above timberline where there is little shelter from storm and wind, it hugs the ground, its woody root firmly inserted in some crevice, where barely sufficient soil has collected to permit its growth. Its flowers nestle in a mass of gray moss-like leaves, whose somber coloring enhances the rare blue of the flowers.
Moss forget-me-not ranges through the Rocky Mountains from New Mexico to Montana and Oregon.
The specimen painted was found on a trail that carried us away from the lower valleys near Apollonaris Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Montana.
