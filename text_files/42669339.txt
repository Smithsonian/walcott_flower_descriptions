ALPINE HAREBELL
Campanula lasiocarpa Chamisso
In the southern part of its range alpine harebell is a comparatively rare plant and is to be found only by those hardy souls who climb to the heights. Here above timberline we found it hiding among the short grasses, as though to gain a little shelter from winds and storms. It was a thrilling experience to come upon so shy and rare a flower.
This attractive little harebell has a northern range, occurring in Alberta, British Columbia, and Alaska. It is found also in Siberia and Japan.
The sketch was made from a flower obtained on Eagle Peak, near Glacier, British Columbia, at an altitude of 8,000 feet.
