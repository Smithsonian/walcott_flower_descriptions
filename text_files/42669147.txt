ROCKY MOUNTAIN RHODODENDRON
Rhododendron albiflorum Hooker
To those familiar with the eastern rhododendrons, with their glossy evergreen leaves, the Rocky Mountain rhododendron is a surprise, for it has deciduous leaves, and the flowers are not in clusters at the ends of the branches, but are scattered along the leafy twigs. The creamy flowers, often tinged with pink, remind us of orange blossoms. Bees are much attracted to them. No one who has traveled over the trails in the Canadian Rockies could have overlooked this beautiful plant. It usually grows in acid soil in company with menziesia and blueberry bushes, on steep, partially shaded slopes.
Rocky Mountain rhododendron has a narrow range, from Montana to Washington, British Columbia, and Alberta.
It is very plentiful at Glacier, British Columbia, where this specimen was gathered at an altitude of 3,500 feet.
