DRUMMOND WILLOW
Salix drummondiana Barratt
In the Canadian Rockies, as late summer arrives, this willow is clothed in its most beautiful garb. Each branch is adorned with loose masses of fluffy cotton, consisting of the seeds and the adhering plumes. These masses are blown far and wide by the wind, and if the plants happen to grow near streams, a windrow of cotton often accumulates along their moist margins. Later this is caught by the water and carried far down stream.
Drummond willow has a narrow range, being confined to Alberta and British Columbia.
The sketch was made from a specimen that grew at Sheep Creek, seventy-five miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
