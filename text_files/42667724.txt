GRASS-PINK ORCHID
Limodorum tuberosum Linnaeus
Grass-pink orchid is to be looked for in bogs and meadows, in June or July. It is one of five species of the genus occurring in the eastern United States, Cuba, and the Bahamas. This member of the Orchid Family is often plentiful in peat bogs, where it is associated with rose pogonia, or other acid-loving plants. The peculiar arrangement of the flower parts, with the crested lip at the top, gives the impression that the blossoms are placed upside down upon the plant, but actually it is the other orchids with their pendent lips which are reversed. The name Limodorum, given by Linnaeus, is derived from the Greek and may be translated as “meadow gift.” Some botanists use for this plant the genus name Calopogon, which means “beautiful beard.”
This orchid is distributed from Florida to Missouri and northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and Newfoundland.
The specimen sketched grew near Tuckerton, New Jersey.
