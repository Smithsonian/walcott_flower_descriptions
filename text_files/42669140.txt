WESTERN MENZIESIA
Menziesia glabella Gray
Many of the steep wooded slopes in the higher valleys of the Northwest Coast are covered with blueberry bushes and other shrubs, and in company with them is found the western menziesia, sometimes called false blueberry. The dainty bells, hanging from the upper portions of the bushes, are tinged with vermilion or pink. When the leaves and stems are crushed, an unpleasant skunklike odor is very evident. The ponies never eat the bush, and so escape the effects of the poison that this plant has recently been proved to contain. The flowers soon wither when hot days come, and are followed by curious little seed vessels. The genus name was given in honor of its discoverer, Archibald Menzies, one of the earliest botanists to visit the Northwest Coast.
The genus Menziesia belongs to the Heath Family. The species ranges from Wyoming to Oregon, British Columbia, and Alberta. It has a relative also in the Appalachian Mountains.
The sketched branch was obtained on the side of the Yoho Valley, near Field, British Columbia, Canada, at an altitude of 6, 500 feet.
