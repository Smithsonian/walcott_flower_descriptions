GREEN STRAWBERRY-CACTUS
Echinocereus viridiflorus Engelman
One of the commonest members of the cactus family in the western United States is the green strawberry-cactus, which grows abundantly in many places in the Rocky Mountain region, usually about rocks on the foothills, or along the stony banks of stream beds. Because of its neat habit, and beautifully colored spines, the plant is one of the most attractive of our cactuses, and is frequently used as a pot plant. The spines, although sharp, are placed in such a manner that they are not very offensive when the plant is handled, in spite of the fact that they protect it effectively from animals which might eat the succulent stem. The flowers are small, and inconspicuously colored. The small green juicy fruits are edible when ripe.
The green strawberry-cactus ranges from western Texas and the desert of northern Mexico as far northward as southern Wyoming.
The specimen sketched came from Texas.
