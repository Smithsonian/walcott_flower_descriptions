TWINLEAF
Jeffersonia diphylla (Linnaeus) Persoon
Jeffersonia, commonly called twinleaf, is one of the earliest of spring flowers. It blooms before the leaves are fully developed, and is somewhat like a bloodroot in appearance. The long-stemmed leaf blades are parted nearly to the base, and as they are blown about by the wind, remind one of a group of green butterflies, though they lose this resemblance when fully developed, for they are then rather stiff, This plant, which was named for Thomas Jefferson, can be easily cultivated in a wildflower garden under the same conditions that will render the bloodroot happy
Jeffersonia is most abundant west of the Appalachian Mountains, from Tennessee northward to Minnesota, Ontario, and central New York; locally, however, it has crossed the mountain barrier and pushed down the river valleys, notably along the Potomac River in Virginia and Maryland.
The sketch was made from a beautiful clump growing on Plummers Island in the Potomac River near Washington, District of Columbia.
