SHOOTINGSTAR
Dodecatheon meadia Linnaeus
Shootingstar is not particular in choosing a habitat, for it is found in open woods, on moist hillsides, or where the meadows broaden into prairies. It belongs to the Primrose Family, and is distantly related to the Asiatic cyclamen familiar in cultivation, being in fact sometimes called wild cyclamen. It thrives in rich garden soil, where the flowers often become larger than in the wild state, and it should find a place in our gardens.
This species of shootingstar has a rather wide distribution, ranging through the prairies, where the flowers are often red, from Texas to Georgia, and northward into Manitoba; it also extends eastward through the Appalachians, reaching the Piedmont from North Catolina to Pennsylvania. The genus Dodecatheon is best represented in the West, where many species occur.
The specimen sketched was obtained near Washington, District of Columbia.
