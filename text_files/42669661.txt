SAN DIEGO MARIPOSA
Calochortus weedii Wood
The San Diego mariposa has a very restricted range, being confined to the desert regions of San Diego County, California, and adjacent Lower California. It loves the steep, dry slopes of the arroyos, where its long stems wave gracefully in the breezes that blow fitfully over the country. The grasslike leaves often turn brown before the flowers have opened. The San Diego mariposa differs from some of its Californian relatives in having its flower cups adorned with beardlike hairs grouped about the nectar gland at the base of each petal.
The specimen sketched was obtained in the outskirts of San Diego, California.
