BOGBEAN
Menyanthes trifoliata Linnaeus
This lovely flower is well protected from molestation by admiring visitors, for it grows in cold swamps or such wet places that rubber boots are a necessity if good specimens are to be obtained. Usually it is associated with thick beds of sphagnum. The white flowers, tinged with pink or purple and glistening in the sun, seem to vie with the bog orchids in beauty. The plant springs from a thick underground rootstock. It belongs to the small Bogbean Family, which is closely related to, and by many authors included in, the Gentian Family.
The range of the bogbean is wide, for it extends from New Jersey and West Virginia to Nebraska and California, and northward to Greenland and Alaska. It is found also in Europe and Asia.
The specimen sketched was collected in a cold bog near the motor road from Lake Louise to Moraine Lake, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,500 feet.
