WESTERN PIPSISSEWA
Chimaphila umbellata var. occidentalis (Rydberg) Blake
Pipsissewa is a shy plant retiring to moss-covered banks in cold dark woods. Its delightful odor calls attention to its presence and its glossy evergreen leaves and dainty pink flowers are soon discovered. After the flowers have withered, the brown seed pods remain sometimes throughout the winter scattering the seeds to the wind. Pipsissewa belongs to the Pyrola group of the Heath Family, and is called sometimes prince's pine.
Western pipsissewa is distributed from New Mexico to Montana, California, and Alaska. Its eastern relative is the typical form of the species and is widespread in the northeastern United States and Canada.
The plant sketched grew on the shore of Emerald Lake, near Field, British Columbia, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
