FOXGLOVE PENTSTEMON
Pentstemon digitalis (Sweet) Nuttall
Foxglove pentstemon thrives in dry meadows and thickets, and in midsummer its tall spikes of large white flowers, which are sometimes tinged with lavender, are very showy. Under cultivation the size of the plant and the abundance of flowers may be improved.
This is one of the few eastern pentstemons, most of the numerous members of the genus being natives of the western mountains. They belong to the Figwort Family, and are related to the garden foxglove. They are often called beardtongues.
Foxglove pentstemon ranges from Georgia northward to Maine, and westward to Arkansas and Illinois.
The specimen sketched grew near Washington, District of Columbia.
