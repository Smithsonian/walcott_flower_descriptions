SWEET ANDROSACE
Androsace carinata Torrey
Sweet androsace is really a spring flower, unfolding on the lower hillsides with the earliest blossoms, but it may be found during most of the summer by ascending to a higher altitude. Its sweet odor and the dainty clustered flowers, with their yellow centers, lend the plant a peculiar charm. The rosettes of stiff green leaves, from which each delicate flower stem rises, give a mosslike appearance to a colony of the plants. They frequent both dry and moist situations. Several related species occur frequently in the northern Rockies, but they are of unattractive appearance, and are seldom noticed.
This member of the Primrose Family ranges from the cold mountain tops of New Mexico north to Alberta and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was found at Ptarmigan Pass, seven miles northeast of Lake Louise, British Columbia, at an altitude of 7,500 feet.
