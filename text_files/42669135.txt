RED DEWBERRY
Rubus pedatus Smith
The rich green leaves of the red dewberry form close mats over the ground, and the star-like white flowers contrast sharply with them. The fruits have usually four or five drupelets, bright red in color, surrounded by a leafy envelope. The stems creep along the ground, rooting at the joints. Both flowers and fruits often are found on the plants at the same time. This member of the Rose Family inhabits cool, damp woods.
In the Selkirk Mountains red dewberry is very plentiful, but our specimen was obtained near the trail leading from the Banff-Windermere motor road at Marble Canyon to Evelyn Glacier, five miles south, in the valley of Vermilion River, fifteen miles from Castle Station on the Canadian Pacific Railway, at an altitude of 6,000 feet.
Red dewberry is found from Montana to California, and northward to Alberta and Alaska.
