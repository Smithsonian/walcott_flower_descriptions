BUR-FORGET-ME-NOT
Lappula diffusa (Lehmann) Greene
Bur-forget-me-not is a lovely plant growing two feet in height and bearing a profusion of delicately scented blue flowers. When it was in fruit we were disillusioned as to its character, for we found that each flower produced a small round bur covered with prickles which attached itself to any passing object and was difficult to loosen. The plant is especially plentiful in the tracks of old snow slides, for it delights in the cool moisture of slopes where much snow has melted. Sometimes the flowers are white.
Bur-forget-me-not ranges from Colorado to California and northward to Alberta and British Columbia.
We found the plant growing near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 5,000 feet.
