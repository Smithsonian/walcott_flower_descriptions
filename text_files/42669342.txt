NORTHERN ANEMONE
Anemone parviflora Michaux
On account of its greater range in altitude, northern anemone flowers during a longer season than most of its relatives. If we climb in midsummer above timberline, we find it in sheltered places where the snow has recently melted, blooming beside the rivulets of snow water. It is able to withstand even the frosty nights of the higher slopes and appears none the worse for the freezing it has experienced. When the flowers are past, a woolly seed head soon develops, and in autumn the seeds are carried away by the wind to new localities. The name Anemone is derived from a Greek word meaning “the wind.” Northern anemone belongs to the Buttercup Family, and has a wide range from Ontario to Labrador, Colorado, and Alaska. It grows also in Asia.
The flowers sketched were found near Wild Flower Camp, twenty-five miles by trail from Lake Louise, Alberta, at an altitude of 7,000 feet.
