VIRGINIA STEWARTIA
Stewartia malachodendron Linnaeus
The few species of stewartia found in the southeastern United States and eastern Asia are all rare and local plants, familiar to few botanists. Their beauty deserves for them a wider acquaintance. This stewartia is a shrub growing from six to twelve feet high, and is usually found in low woods. The unusual coloring of the stamens, especially the anthers, gives the flowers a very remarkable appearance, and the leaves in autumn are colored brilliantly with red and orange. The genus name was given in honor of John Stuart, Earl of Bute, a patron of botany, but Linnaeus adopted the name in the form Stewartia. It belongs to the Tea Family.
Stewartia ranges from Florida to Virginia and west to Louisiana.
The sketch was made from a specimen gathered on Ladys Island near Beaufort, South Carolina.
