LILAC MARIPOSA
Calochortus splendens Douglas
It is a difficult matter to restrain one’s enthusiasm, while riding overt the foothills in California, when the mariposas are in bloom. Their great variety is marvelous, and as their stems are so slender, they truly appear like a host of butterflies as they sway in the wind. One of the loveliest of them all is the lilac mariposa. It was a beautiful day when we found them at the Santa Ana Ranch near Santa Ana, California, and each specimen seemed more beautiful than the last.
The mariposas are members of the Lily Family, related to the garden tulips, which are derived from Old World species belonging to a different genus. The mariposas are of purely west-American range, no variety being found east of Nebraska. Some of the mariposas have edible bulbs, which are highly valued by the Indians.
