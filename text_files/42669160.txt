RUFF GENTIAN
Gentiana calycosa Grisebach
The flowers of this lovely gentian are of a wonderful deep blue color. As soon as the direct rays of the sun strike them, the petals open, and the clumps are covered with brilliant flowers. On a cloudy day, when they are closed, it is easy to pass without noticing them, even where they are abundant. The plants are usually found about tree line, or in grassy alpine meadows at a slightly lower altitude. The large calyx suggests a sixteenth century ruff.
Ruff gentian ranges from Montana and Wyoming to Washington and California.
We found quantities of this gentian at Indian Pass in Glacier National Park, at an altitude of 6,500 feet.
