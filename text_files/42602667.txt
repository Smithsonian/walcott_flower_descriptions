RED-OSIER DOGWOOD
Cornus stolonifera Michaux
The red-osier dogwood is an attractive shrub, not only when in bloom but also in the early fall, when its bunches of bluish-white berries are borne in abundance, and the leaves change in color to scarlet, purple, or gold. The Indians used the scraped inner bark for smoking purposes, and preferred it to any other plant, giving it the name “kinnikinnick”. In winter the slender, graceful, purplish-red stems are conspicuous and distinctive.
Red-osier dogwood may be found from Virginia to Newfoundland, and from Mexico to Alaska, and at many places in the interior of the continent.
The specimen sketched grew at Radium Hot Springs, in the Columbia River Valley, British Columbia, at 3,000 feet elevation.
