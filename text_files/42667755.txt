SPOTTED SAXIFRAGE
Saxifraga bronchialis Linnaeus
Spotted saxifrage grows most plentifully about tree line. It grows in masses over the rocks, in whose crevices its roots find a foothold. The Latin specific name is derived from saxum, a rock, and frango, I break. The dark green foliage retains its color through the winter, and gives to the beds of the plant a mosslike appearance. The flowers are visited by great numbers of bees and flies. Sometimes the spots on the petals are green or yellow instead of red, the other characters of the plant remaining the same. In nature's rock gardens these hardy plants, wherever they grow, lend grace and beauty to the scene. 
This saxifrage (which has also been called Leptasea austromontana) is found from Utah and New Mexico northward to Alberta and British Columbia and Alaska. It grows also in northern Asia and Europe.
The specimen sketched was collected near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, at an altitude of 6,500.
