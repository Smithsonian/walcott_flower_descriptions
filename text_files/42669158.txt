COLUMBIA LILY
Lilium columbianum Hanson
The western lilies are always a joy to behold. Many of them rise on tall stems above the surrounding vegetation, which forms a perfect background for their graceful beauty. The Columbia lily shown in the illustration was obtained in Indian Henrys Garden in Mount Rainier National Park, at an altitude of 2,000 feet, where the plants are more delicate than those found at lower elevations.
Columbia lily ranges from California to Idaho and British Columbia.
