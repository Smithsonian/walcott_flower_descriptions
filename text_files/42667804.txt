ARUM ARROWHEAD
Sagittaria cuneata Sheldon
This arrowhead, like its relatives, loves mud and water, sending up its graceful leaves and flower stalks, with delicate flowers, out of the muck. The name Sagittaria, derived from the Latin, refers to the arrow-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the Waterplantain Family. Arum arrowhead ranges from Connecticut to Maine and Nova Scotia, and westward to Kansas, New Mexico, California, and British Columbia.
The specimen sketched was found near Edgewater, British Columbia, in the valley of the Columbia River, at an elevation of 2,700 feet.
