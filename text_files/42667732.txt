LONGLEAF PINE
Pinus palustris Miller
A journey from Virginia south to Florida traverses the region in which longleaf pine abounds. This is a stately tree, sometimes attaining a height of 120 feet, with a trunk five feet in diameter. Often it forms extensive forests along the coastal plain. The long leaves clustered near the ends of the branches give a strikingly feathery and quite distinctive appearance to the tree. When in bloom, the clustered spikes of flowers are very beautiful. Clouds of pollen are blown from them by the wind. This tree is the principal source of turpentine, pine tar, and rosin. The wood is hard and strong and either light red or orange in color.
Longleaf pine ranges along the coast from Texas to Florida, and northward to Virginia.
The specimen sketched was obtained on Ladys Island, near Beaufort, South Carolina.
